#'A Source to handle .eml output from ProQuest
#'
#'@description Constructs a Source to handle documents sent by email from
#'  ProQuest, in .eml format.
#'
#'@param x A filename string or connection
#'
#'@details An attempt is made to fill up the standard `tm` metadata fields if
#'  explicit mappings are not provided (or produce NULL). The `datetimestamp`
#'  output field is taken as the first available of the following:
#'  `datetimestamp` input field, `modtime` input field, `firstpubtime` input
#'  field, `fetchtime` input field, or (if all else fails) the current date and
#'  time, with a warning. `author` is taken by concatenating (with commas) the
#'  `bylines` input field. `description` is taken from the input `summary`
#'  field, and `heading` from `headline`. `origin` is taken from `source`,
#'  failing which the filename of the input file is used.
#'
#'  The returned documents have IDs constructed to be unique under all normal
#'  circumstances. This is based on the input file's `source` field (if
#'  available), the document date (drawn from the input file's `modtime`,
#'  failing that `firstpubtime`, failing that `fetchtime`, failing that the
#'  current date with a warning), the document's sequence number in the input
#'  file, and an 8 character MD5 digest of the document's metadata list.
#'
#'  Note that an attempt is made to handle forwarded emails (rather than those
#'  directly from ProQuest) but this may well not be successful.
#'
#'@return An object of class `ProQuestSource`, inheriting from
#'  [tm::SimpleSource].

  # If this email is straight from ProQuest, it seems to have the following
  # format:
  #
  # Header lines (including a Content-Type: multipart/mixed header)
  #
  # Part boundary header for the main section with Content-Type: text/html,
  # Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
  #
  # Main HTML section:
  #   Starting with an XHTML 1.0 Strict doctype and header
  #   Continuing with a <table> containing a copyright notice
  #   Then continuing with a note saying that {user} sent the following
  #   Then with an email sequence number for the download
  #   *Then a series of top-level <div>s each containing a document*
  #   Then ending with a copyright footer
  #
  # Part boundary header for the ProQuest logo, Content-Type: image/gif, base64
  #
  # base64 image data for ProQuest logo
  #
  # Part boundary header for library logo (always? don't know)
  #
  # base64 image data for library logo
  #
  # Final part boundary

  # We also try to handle *some* cases where the email has been forwarded, with
  # different headers, potentially an extra message added, and possibly with the
  # parts in a different order. We cannot successfully handle all forwards: at
  # worst, it will have been forwarded plain text, and none of the HTML
  # information at all will be available, which will stop the entire parsing
  # strategy working. But we do our best.
