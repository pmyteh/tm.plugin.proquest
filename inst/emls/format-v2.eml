<p>WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 Saddled with daunting logistical and political obst=
acles, the 2020 census seriously undercounted the number of Hispanic, Black=
 and Native American residents even though its overall population count was=
 largely accurate, the Census Bureau said Thursday.</p>
<p>At the same time, the census overcounted white and Asian American reside=
nts, the bureau said.</p>
<p>In essence, the bureau=E2=80=99s report said, minority groups =E2=80=94 =
mostly concentrated in cities and tribal areas =E2=80=94 were underrepresen=
ted in census figures, even though the total population count in those area=
s often was fairly accurate. That could affect those groups=E2=80=99 politi=
cal clout, and conceivably could sway decisions by businesses and governmen=
ts over the next decade, from the allocation of city services to locations =
of stores.</p>
<p>Some minority advocacy groups threatened to challenge the results in cou=
rt, but remedying the undercounts would be difficult if not impossible, exp=
erts said.</p>
<p>Robert Santos, the bureau=E2=80=99s director, said that despite the omis=
sions, the results were consistent with recent censuses.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis is notable, given the unprecedented challenges of 2020,=E2=
=80=9D he said in a statement. =E2=80=9CBut the results also include some l=
imitations; the 2020 census undercounted many of the same population groups=
 we have historically undercounted, and it overcounted others.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Those challenges included the coronavirus pandemic, which hamstrung effo=
rts to interview people in person, and interference by the Trump administra=
tion, which tried to remove noncitizens from the count and, later, to end t=
he counting process weeks early.</p>
<p>But some obstacles face every census count. The census has historically =
undercounted populations that are harder to reach through surveys, phone ca=
lls and door-to-door canvassing, including Native Americans on reservations=
, poor urban communities and immigrants living in the country illegally.</p=
>
<p>The estimates released Thursday covered the count of 323.2 million peopl=
e who were living in households on April 1, 2020, the official census date.=
 Counts of others, such as prison inmates and students in college dormitori=
es, pushed the total population count to 331.45 million.
</p><p>
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a leading expert on the census and consultant to gover=
nments and others with a stake in the count, called the results =E2=80=9Ctr=
oubling but not entirely surprising.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COverall, the results are less accurate than in 2010,=E2=80=9D s=
he said.</p>
<p>
By the bureau=E2=80=99s estimates, the 2020 tally incorrectly counted 18.8 =
million residents, double-counting some 5.2 million people, wrongly includi=
ng another 2 million and missing others entirely, even as it came extremely=
 close to reaching an accurate count of the overall population. Many of the=
 people whom the census originally failed to count were picked up and added=
 to final census totals through a process called imputation =E2=80=94 a sta=
tistical guess, using complex algorithms, of who was living in places that =
census takers could not reach.</p>
<p>Those imputations, however, did not guess the race or ethnicity of missi=
ng residents. That partly explains why the grand total count of residents w=
as substantially accurate, even as many minorities were missed.</p>
<p>Although the bureau did not say how many people it missed entirely, they=
 were mostly people of color, disproportionately young ones. The census mis=
sed counting 4.99 of every 100 Hispanics, 5.64 of every 100 Native American=
s and 3.3 of every 100 African Americans.</p>
<p>In contrast, for every 100 residents counted, the census wrongly added 1=
.64 non-Hispanic whites and 2.62 ethnic Asians.</p>
<p>Young people in general were undercounted: by 2.79% for children under 5=
, and, among those ages 18 to 29, 2.25% for men and 0.98% for women. Older =
residents were overcounted, most significantly by 2.63% for women 50 and ol=
der.</p>
<p>The estimates released Thursday =E2=80=94 in essence, a statistical adju=
stment of totals made public last year =E2=80=94 are based on an examinatio=
n of federal records and an extensive survey in which the bureau interviewe=
d residents in some 10,000 census blocks =E2=80=94 the smallest unit used i=
n census tabulations. Bureau experts then compared their answers to the act=
ual census results for those blocks.</p>
<p>The survey enabled the bureau to estimate how many residents it missed e=
ntirely in the 2020 count, how many people were counted twice and how many =
people =E2=80=94 such as short-term visitors and people who died before or =
were born after the official April 1, 2020, census date =E2=80=94 were coun=
ted mistakenly.</p>
<p>Some advocacy groups for minority populations expressed outrage at the u=
ndercounts. In a news release, Arturo Vargas, the CEO of the NALEO Educatio=
nal Fund, which represents Latinos, called the counting errors a =E2=80=9Cf=
ive-alarm fire=E2=80=9D and questioned whether the results should be used.<=
/p>
<p>Marc Morial, the CEO of the National Urban League, called the undercount=
 of Black people a tragedy, adding, =E2=80=9CAny options we have, including=
 litigation, will be on the table.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Experts said, however, that those unhappy with the results had limited o=
ptions. Earlier census figures already have been used to reapportion seats =
in the House of Representatives and state legislatures, among other governi=
ng bodies.</p>
<p>The estimates released Thursday do not affect redistricting. They reflec=
t only errors in the national population count, and final refinements, due =
this summer, would only break down wrong counts by state.</p>
<p>While they decried the scope of the flaws in the 2020 census, some exper=
ts noted that many undercounts and other errors were not statistically diff=
erent from those in the 2010 count. And that, they said, was a triumph all =
by itself.
</p><p>
The most intriguing question is how the Census Bureau managed such an accur=
ate count given the hurdles it faced, said Steve Jost, a former census offi=
cial and consultant to the Census Project, a coalition of organizations tha=
t advocates an accurate count.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CTo pull off the nation=E2=80=99s largest peacetime mobilization=
 in the middle of a once-a-century pandemic and operational interference fr=
om the White House is a remarkable achievement,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
<p>
The 2020 census faced a series of challenges. The coronavirus pandemic shut=
 down much of the count just as it was beginning in April 2020, forcing the=
 bureau to extend its work by nearly two months. Later in the year, wildfir=
es in the West and coastal hurricanes upended the bureau=E2=80=99s work jus=
t as door-knockers were fanning out to survey millions of households that h=
ad not filled out their forms.</p>
<p>The Trump administration later moved up the deadline to finish the count=
ing, raising concerns about an undercount. The problems led many experts, i=
ncluding some senior Census Bureau officials, to worry that the final count=
 would be fatally flawed.</p>
<p>In September, a 59-page analysis of the 2020 census commissioned and rev=
iewed by the American Statistical Association said the count appeared accur=
ate enough for its overriding constitutional purpose: reallocating the 435 =
seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But the experts who drafted the report limited their findings to the ove=
rall national tally and counts in the 50 states and the District of Columbi=
a. Much more study would be needed, they said, to gauge the reliability of =
local population totals and characteristics such as race and ethnicity that=
 are vital parts of every census.

<p>NEW YORK =E2=80=94 The sun rises on a weekday in New York City, and at a=
 Queens subway station the daily grind resembles its old self: Thousands of=
 people pile onto an open-air platform above a bustling neighborhood, waiti=
ng in the cold to crowd onto rush-hour trains toward work, school and other=
 essential appointments.</p>
<p>Hours later, as darkness falls, another rush hour begins. But this one, =
at a formerly hectic subway station in lower Manhattan, feels jarringly dif=
ferent. In a neighborhood lined with office buildings, a once-reliable stre=
am of white-collar commuters has thinned to a trickle. As trains arrive, fi=
nding a seat is not hard.</p>
<p>Nearly two years after the coronavirus engulfed New York, causing a virt=
ual abandonment of the country=E2=80=99s largest transportation network, ri=
ders have slowly returned to the subway in an uneven pattern that underscor=
es the economic divide at the heart of the city=E2=80=99s fitful recovery.<=
/p>
<p>Stations in lower-income areas in Brooklyn, Queens and upper Manhattan, =
where residents are less likely to be able to work from home and typically =
depend more on public transit, have rebounded far faster than stations in o=
ffice-heavy sections of Manhattan, including some that were once the busies=
t in the system, where many workers are still able to work remotely.</p>
<p>The problems hobbling the subway have gotten worse since the arrival of =
the fast-spreading omicron variant, which has reversed a recovery that had =
been progressing for months. The system is also contending with fears about=
 crime and public safety that were amplified after a woman was shoved to he=
r death in front of a train on Saturday by a 61-year-old man at the Times S=
quare station.</p>
<p>After cratering by 90% in the spring of 2020, weekday subway ridership i=
n November had reached about 56% of prepandemic levels, with 3.1 million ri=
ders on an average day, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Author=
ity, which operates the system.</p>
<p>But with the omicron variant sickening so many workers, transit official=
s suspended service on some lines and reduced it on others. As virus cases =
surged, passengers who could avoid public transit did so, and ridership lev=
els fell at the start of this year to about 40%.</p>
<p>The dip in ridership reflects a central challenge facing the subway, a v=
ital lifeline linked to New York=E2=80=99s economy. Without the wholesale r=
eturn of daily commuters =E2=80=94 whose money is the lifeblood of public t=
ransit and of a vast network of businesses inside and outside stations =E2=
=80=94 the city=E2=80=99s subway system finds itself suspended in an unsett=
ling limbo.</p>
<p>In a financial plan released last month, the authority projected that ev=
en by 2025, the subway would have 223 million fewer riders than it did in 2=
019, a drop of about 13%, as many workers shift to hybrid work schedules. A=
 significant drop in ridership will reduce fares the system is dependent on=
 and could lead to fare hikes and service cuts.</p>
<p>The agency=E2=80=99s acting chair and CEO, Janno Lieber, said he remaine=
d hopeful that the subway=E2=80=99s recovery would resume after concern aro=
und the omicron variant subsided, though how quickly is unclear.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe trajectory of that return has been impacted, and we don=E2=
=80=99t know exactly where it=E2=80=99s headed,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9C=
But for us, the key is that when people have somewhere to go, they take tra=
nsit.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At the same time, Lieber acknowledged that most riders who had not yet r=
eturned were unlikely to do so until they had a compelling need =E2=80=94 w=
hich for many, he said, would require =E2=80=9Cwork in an office.=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
<p>Still, despite the steep decline in ridership, millions of people have g=
one back to the subway, in most cases out of necessity. But how the subway =
feels and functions can vary wildly from station to station, and the experi=
ences of those riding hint at the barriers to drawing back those who are no=
t.</p>
<p><b>Through the Pandemic=E2=80=99s Throes, Work Never Stopped</b>
</p>
<p><b>Junction Boulevard Station, Queens</b>
</p>
<p>The daily commute never stopped for many blue-collar workers who rely on=
 the No. 7 train in central Queens =E2=80=94 an epicenter of the coronaviru=
s where in the spring of 2020 thousands fell ill and hundreds died.</p>
<p>Luis Rocano, a construction worker from the Corona neighborhood, waited =
at the Junction Boulevard station just before dawn to head to a job in Manh=
attan.</p>
<p>As Corona, a predominantly Latino neighborhood served by the station, fi=
lled with the wail of ambulances, Rocano=E2=80=99s fears grew. Yet even as =
the number of people he knew killed by COVID-19 ticked up, Rocano, 33, had =
to work.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was total chaos,=E2=80=9D he said in Spanish. =E2=80=9CWe sa=
w so much death in such a short amount of time.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At its lowest point, in April 2020, ridership at the Junction Boulevard =
station fell to about 10% of prepandemic levels. But eventually people in t=
his nexus of working-class immigrant neighborhoods piled back on the trains=
. By November 2020, ridership rose to 55.3% of prepandemic levels; one year=
 later, it had climbed to 74.2%.</p>
<p>On this frigid December morning, Junction Boulevard=E2=80=99s open-air p=
latform was nearly shoulder to shoulder. Commuters rushed onto Manhattan-bo=
und trains, some wearing paint-stained jeans and hoisting construction tool=
s as the sun pierced the horizon.</p>
<p>Rocano tried to take precautions. Still, he ended up contracting the vir=
us.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAfter I got sick, I was less afraid that I would get it again,=
=E2=80=9D Rocano said. =E2=80=9CI just got used to wearing a mask everywher=
e.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Virus-related health concerns remain top of mind. According to a custome=
r survey the transportation authority conducted last fall, 79% of subway cu=
stomers who had not returned to the trains said that social-distancing conc=
erns were among the top factors keeping them off trains.</p>
<p>But in neighborhoods like Corona, home to a high concentration of unauth=
orized immigrants who have largely been ineligible for federal pandemic aid=
, the overriding worry is the need to make ends meet. About 47% of Queens r=
esidents were born outside the United States =E2=80=94 10 percentage points=
 higher than the city as a whole =E2=80=94 according to Census Bureau figur=
es.
</p><p>
=E2=80=9CThe street workers have to go out in the heat and the cold,=E2=80=
=99=E2=80=99 said Raquel Chasi, an unauthorized immigrant from Ecuador who =
sells fruit juice from a stand below the elevated station. =E2=80=9CWe have=
 to keep fighting to bring bread to our homes.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Although foot traffic is up, Chasi, 36, said many people were spending l=
ess. Some struggle with higher costs triggered by the pandemic-rattled supp=
ly chain. She complained about having to pay twice as much for the plastic =
cups she serves to clients.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt has hit us very hard,=E2=80=9D she shouted in Spanish over t=
he roar of trains. Before 2020, Chasi could make up to $600 on a good day a=
t the stand she has run seven days a week for the past seven years. Now, sh=
e is lucky to reach $200.</p>
<p>
<b>Riders Reflect on a Changed System</b>
</p>
<p><b>59th Street Station, Brooklyn</b>
</p>
<p>Ten miles southwest and below ground, the crowds at the 59th Street stat=
ion in Brooklyn=E2=80=99s Sunset Park neighborhood had been about half that=
 of higher-traffic hubs like Junction Boulevard. But the rise in passengers=
 here has been accelerating: On November weekdays, ridership averaged about=
 74% of prepandemic levels.</p>
<p>Blocks away from the heart of Brooklyn=E2=80=99s Chinatown on 8th Avenue=
, the N and R trains stop at the station to serve a multicultural populatio=
n that includes one of the largest enclaves of Chinese immigrants in New Yo=
rk. About 40% of people in the surrounding area identify as Hispanic and ro=
ughly the same as Asian, according to the most recent U.S. census.</p>
<p>On a recent Tuesday morning, a mix of people traveled to jobs across the=
 economic spectrum, trudging down the stairs in coveralls, scrubs, collars =
and hoodies, headed for auto shops, medical laboratories, patients=E2=80=99=
 homes and office cubicles.
</p><p>
=E2=80=9CWe have to be in the office,=E2=80=9D said Demetri Perry, 29, a 31=
1 phone operator returning home to Flatbush. Hired in the spring of 2020, h=
e recalled 59th Street=E2=80=99s then strangely empty platforms: =E2=80=9CI=
t was like the zombie apocalypse.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
Cristian Cruz, a 44-year-old cancer research technician, has used this stat=
ion for 25 years, including during the pandemic=E2=80=99s early days. While=
 waiting for an N train to his lab on the Upper East Side, he said fears of=
 COVID transmission and a desire for space changed what had once been among=
 the most fraught of subway interactions: negotiating a sliver of seating b=
etween two riders.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBefore, people would fight, jump in and try to get in that spac=
e,=E2=80=9D Cruz said. =E2=80=9CPeople now, they don=E2=80=99t go as hard t=
o get into every seat. They=E2=80=99ll stay standing.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
The loss of riders has ripple effects for the neighborhood businesses. Anni=
e Li, the manager of the Koong Wing Chinese restaurant, can see riders ente=
ring and leaving the subway through her storefront window.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Li said in Mandarin, the rumble of the train below =
would signal an immediate crush of business. =E2=80=9CAll of a sudden, the =
subway comes and then you=E2=80=99re swarmed.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNow, I don=E2=80=99t see that phenomenon anymore,=E2=80=9D she =
said. =E2=80=9COnly until it gets to the point that we can be without masks=
, maybe, will we go back to normal.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
<b>Money Still Flows But Riders Don=E2=80=99t</b>
</p>
<p><b>Wall Street Station, Manhattan</b>
</p>
<p>For decades, people used to pour through the marble-and-tile atrium at 6=
0 Wall Street, which houses an entrance to the Wall Street subway station. =
In early 2020, four businesses greeted them: a convenience store, a cafe, a=
 restaurant and a shoe-repair shop.</p>
<p>But on a recent Tuesday, the atrium was hushed, and most of the stores w=
ere shuttered.</p>
<p>Only the shoe-repair store, Cobbler Express, had reopened, and the owner=
, Eduard Shimonov, said it had passed for a busy day. Instead of the one or=
 two shoe shines that marked business these days, the store had done three.=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou just don=E2=80=99t have the same foot traffic,=E2=80=9D Shi=
monov, 41, said, sitting on a shoe shine booth.</p>
<p>The picture is much the same inside the subway station that used to prov=
ide all four businesses with a steady parade of white-collar workers.</p>
<p>On an average weekday before the pandemic, more than 24,000 riders passe=
d through the turnstiles of the Wall Street station. In November, the numbe=
r was down to about 9,000 riders, about 37.5% of its 2019 level and far bel=
ow the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Instead of a massive nightly exodus from high-rise office buildings to a=
 narrow underground platform, the ritual is smaller. From 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.,=
 the Wall Street station was muted.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s still some movement,=E2=80=9D said Claude LaRoc=
he, a lawyer heading to Pennsylvania Station, where he=E2=80=99d take the L=
ong Island Rail Road to his home in Lake Grove, New York. =E2=80=9CBut it=
=E2=80=99s eerie. And nowhere near as crowded.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Transit officials blame much of the drop on the seismic shift to remote =
work, an upheaval to the rhythms of the city with no clear end.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, about 80% of Manhattan office workers were in their=
 offices on a given weekday, said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partn=
ership for New York City, an influential business advocacy organization.</p=
>
<p>Even before the omicron variant, the Partnership had projected that only=
 49% of workers would be in offices by the end of this month, with just 13%=
 returning full time.</p>
<p>Wylde said the recent surge appears to have pushed that projection out o=
f reach. Many employers again delayed when they expect workers to come back=
 to the office, and some now acknowledge that remote work has moved from a =
temporary disruption to a longer-term norm.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think most employers believe that there will be=
 a moment where everyone goes back,=E2=80=9D Wylde said.</p>
<p>LaRoche exemplifies the shift: He works from the office three times a we=
ek, choosing days when he feels trains are emptier.
</p><p>
Even those who have embraced returning to daily commuting said they were an=
xious. Risa Kantor, who never fully stopped traveling from the Upper West S=
ide to her office, said that she would feel more at ease if other riders st=
rictly adhered to the subway=E2=80=99s mask requirement.</p>
<p>Kantor, who works for a nonprofit that helps people with disabilities, a=
lso said that she would not ride the train alone outside commuting hours ou=
t of concern over crime and violence.</p>
<p>
Subway crime last year was at its lowest total in decades, according to the=
 police and the MTA, but though the total number of major felonies on the s=
ubway is down from 2019, so is ridership, and the rate of crimes per millio=
n weekday passengers has actually increased. Many crimes were high-profile =
attacks that generated significant news coverage and fed a perception that =
the system was perilous.</p>
<p>In the authority=E2=80=99s customer survey, fear over crime and harassme=
nt was the top factor cited by former riders who have left the subways; 90%=
 of them said it was important to their decision whether to return.</p>
<p>The mayor and Police Department recently announced more frequent and vis=
ible patrols on platforms and trains. The transit authority has also been o=
n a marketing blitz, promoting the benefits of the subway =E2=80=94 ease, c=
limate, cost =E2=80=94 in a bid to bring riders back.</p>
<p>But the immediate future remains dreary, for the system and for business=
 owners like Shimonov. Many of his former customers do not live in the city=
 and no longer travel to their offices. The stragglers he used to get from =
the subway station have also disappeared.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI just hope this gets better soon. Otherwise, I=E2=80=99ll have=
 to do something serious,=E2=80=9D Shimonov said. =E2=80=9CIf this keeps up=
, people are going to lose a good cobbler, and that=E2=80=99s a pity for th=
e city.=E2=80=9D

<p>Late one evening 55 years ago, in the winter of 1966, an Irish American =
teenager named Gwen Taylor climbed through the window of her family=E2=80=
=99s house in Coalinga, a small town in California=E2=80=99s San Joaquin Va=
lley, and, flipping up the kickstand on a bicycle parked outside, pedaled b=
y moonlight through the vineyards of this farming region, and across Inters=
tate 5 to a town called Huron.</p>
<p>No more than 15 miles separated two places that were, in crucial ways, u=
niverses apart. As late as the 1960s, the inhabitants of Coalinga, a onetim=
e railway coaling station, were primarily Caucasian, whereas Huron was popu=
lated largely by Mexican Americans or Mexican migrants who regularly risked=
 the illegal border crossing in search of seasonal work harvesting the worl=
d=E2=80=99s tomatoes, melons, sugar beets, grapes and asparagus.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy mother hates when I tell this story,=E2=80=9D designer Willy=
 Chavarria said over a glass of chilled white wine on a recent rainy evenin=
g, referring to his origins as the son of a white girl from a =E2=80=9Csund=
own town,=E2=80=9D where it was once thought unsafe for those with brown sk=
in to be seen after nightfall, and of William Robles Chavarria, a migrant w=
orker himself and an activist whose mother on occasion fed Cesar Chavez, th=
e legendary civil rights activist and co-founder of the National Farm Worke=
rs Association, at her kitchen table.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMy parents met in high school, which began to be integrated onl=
y after the civil rights movement,=E2=80=9D Chavarria, 54, said. =E2=80=9CS=
he used to sneak out of the house and ride to Huron through the crop fields=
 to see my father.=E2=80=9D And then unexpectedly, in July 1967, =E2=80=9Cl=
ittle Willy came along.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>In order to understand Willy Chavarria and his decadeslong rise through =
the ranks of fashion, first as a journeyman designer for mass-market labels=
 like Joe Boxer, Ralph Lauren and American Eagle to the founding in 2015 of=
 a critically lauded indie label and his surprise hire early this year as a=
 senior vice president at Calvin Klein, it helps to understand his origins.=
</p>
<p>A queer man of mixed race, a son of working-class folk, Chavarria may be=
 the most highly placed Latino currently at work on the creative end of the=
 American fashion industry. Though not yet a household name, he soon should=
 be, say industry experts familiar with Chavarria=E2=80=99s outsize gifts a=
nd unusual career.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99s obviously a huge talent,=E2=80=9D Karla Martinez d=
e Salas, the editor of Vogue Mexico, said recently. =E2=80=9CBut it=E2=80=
=99s in terms of representation that his appointment is an even a bigger de=
al.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Mexican American herself, Martinez related a story of growing up in El P=
aso, Texas, where she passed a large part of her childhood trying to =E2=80=
=9Cfit into=E2=80=9D an Anglo-dominated culture, one that expected people l=
ike her to alter themselves to conform to Eurocentric beauty ideals. =E2=80=
=9CGrowing up a slightly dark-skinned kid, a Latina, in the U.S., there was=
 nothing speaking to us,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAnd before Oscar, Narciso and Carolina came along, there was no=
thing at all,=E2=80=9D Martinez added, referring to Oscar de la Renta, Narc=
iso Rodriguez and Carolina Herrera =E2=80=94 Americans of, respectively, Do=
minican, Cuban and Venezuelan ancestry. And before Chavarria, there wasn=E2=
=80=99t anything at the commercial or street level to speak to the complexi=
ties of a Latino population that Census Bureau figures put at more than 60 =
million, a group that defies any attempt to reduce or define it according t=
o monolithic stereotypes.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe potential effect of having someone who understands all of o=
ur dualities at a label as influential as Calvin is just incredible,=E2=80=
=9D Martinez said.</p>
<p>Jess Lomax, the creative director for global design at Calvin Klein, was=
 a senior creative director at Nike before she was named in late 2020 to he=
lp right a listing corporate behemoth. =E2=80=9CWilly was an obvious hire, =
one of the very first additions I made,=E2=80=9D Lomax said.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d followed him for some time,=E2=80=9D she added, cit=
ing among his many strengths Chavarria=E2=80=99s solid formalism, adventuro=
us play with proportion, rootedness in his own culture and lifelong embrace=
 of diversity in all its dispersions.</p>
<p>As much as anything, it was his democratic vision of fashion that attrac=
ted her to Chavarria, said Lomax, who is seeking to radically recast the co=
rporate vision of a premier American label, one that somehow lost its way u=
nder the direction of Belgian designer Raf Simons.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBeauty, cultural relevance, how a product connects to a custome=
r =E2=80=94 all of that is so, so important,=E2=80=9D Lomax said. =E2=80=9C=
Willy brings all of that.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
Case in point: Chavarria=E2=80=99s quiet role in devising Kanye West=E2=80=
=99s Yeezy Gap collaboration, created over a two-year period during which, =
despite the travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 virus, Chavarria co=
mmuted regularly from Copenhagen, where he lives with his husband, David Ra=
mirez, a vice president at the Danish Pandora jewelry company, to West=E2=
=80=99s ranch in Cody, Wyoming, and his compound in Calabasas, California.<=
/p>
<p>Though Chavarria is tight-lipped about what part he played in forming th=
e collection, referring to himself modestly as a =E2=80=9Cconsultant,=E2=80=
=9D anyone familiar with his work can detect his hand in designs like the c=
ollarless $200 =E2=80=9Cround jacket=E2=80=9D puffer West teased on Instagr=
am in June and that sold out so quickly that examples are now being offered=
 for as much as $1,500 on Grailed and other websites.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COne of the genius gifts Kanye has is that he is constantly scou=
ring the world for talent,=E2=80=9D said Chavarria, whom West contacted in =
2018 after spotting a review of a Chavarria show at New York Fashion Week: =
Men=E2=80=99s that the designer had staged in the beer-scented hallways and=
 backrooms of the venerable gay leather bar, the Eagle, which opened for bu=
siness in 1970.</p>
<p>
As in prior shows that overtly explored themes of immigration, gender dysph=
oria, ableism and other hot-button issues, Chavarria fused dimensions of hi=
s own cultural experience growing up in California to those of fragile, if =
historically disfavored, subcultures like gay practitioners of BDSM.</p>
<p>Taking aspects of =E2=80=9Clowrider style,=E2=80=9D like crisp oversize =
shirts, their shoulders dropped and ornamented with ruching; or skirt-wide =
khakis he termed =E2=80=9Ccholo pants=E2=80=9D and then cinched with karate=
 obis; or tracksuits with satin inlays shown under studded biker jackets an=
d accessorized with gnarly studded belts or leather Muir caps no self-respe=
cting leather daddy would be seen without, he produced results that were as=
 starkly beautiful as they were original and unexpected.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI wanted to use from my past the beautiful things that emerged =
when I was growing up around Chicano culture,=E2=80=9D Chavarria said then.=
 He seamlessly married those tropes to stylistic elements of a scene he may=
 never have participated in but had long admired from afar.
</p><p>
Chavarria cast that show, titled =E2=80=9CCruising,=E2=80=9D as he has each=
 successive one since he incorporated, with an array of models drawn both f=
rom inside the industry and far outside its customary reach. Take a casting=
 for his next show, =E2=80=9CCut Deep,=E2=80=9D which was inspired by deliv=
ery men, he said, and is set to take place Sept. 8 at a storied barbershop =
on Astor Place.</p>
<p>For this show he instructed his casting director, Brent Chua, to send ou=
t a call for young guys with, yes, agency representation, but also ordinary=
 types with the sort of everyday beauty few bother to notice because, as Ch=
avarria said, =E2=80=9Cnobody bothers to look up at the DoorDash guy.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d been in the business so long before I went out on m=
y own that the point became not so much seeing how much volume you could se=
ll, but how much beauty you could create,=E2=80=9D said Chavarria, whose Jo=
e Boxer days were governed by sales goals rather far more than design. =E2=
=80=9CIt was how many banana print boxers do we need to sell.</p>
<p>
That he intends, at his own label and at Calvin Klein, to build something c=
ulturally reparative could be sensed from the responses of the hopefuls tha=
t turned up for the casting: construction workers and musicians and street-=
scouted newcomers, few of whom had considered themselves beautiful, let alo=
ne marketable to the restrictive sphere of fashion, as it turned out.</p>
<p>They were men like Elias Priddie, 24, a soulful-looking day-laborer and =
sometime bare-knuckle boxer from the Bronx, who =E2=80=9Cnever even thought=
 I could be good-looking,=E2=80=9D as he explained. They were men like Chac=
hi Martinez, 28, one of Chavarria=E2=80=99s designated muses, =E2=80=9Ca to=
tal sweetheart, though he does look kind of scary,=E2=80=9D as the designer=
 said, owing to Martinez=E2=80=99s abundant SoCal gang-style tattoos.</p>
<p>Or they were lanky types like Antonio Macek, 20, a longhaired former ama=
teur hurdler of Black and Czech ancestry who had grown up being termed eith=
er too pretty or plain ugly or told he was weird. =E2=80=9CI was looked at =
as different because I didn=E2=80=99t look like a normal person,=E2=80=9D M=
acek said.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThere are so many ways in this world in which we are kept, or w=
e keep ourselves, from being beautiful,=E2=80=9D said Chavarria, who has he=
ld onto a SoHo apartment, as much as anything for its easy access to Tompki=
ns Square Park in the East Village, one of the last bastions, in a fast-hom=
ogenizing city, of racial and gender diversity.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s this really damaging loss of psychic and even p=
hysical territory if the culture never gives you any confirmation of your t=
ype of beauty,=E2=80=9D Chavarria said.</p>
<p>Imagine, said Corey Stokes, the fashion director of Highsnobiety, that o=
ne=E2=80=99s daily experience resembled that of Macek, the ex-athlete told =
all his life he looked strange. =E2=80=9CI get chills when I think about be=
ing in the most impressionable years of your life and not being represented=
,=E2=80=9D Stokes said. =E2=80=9CNot thinking of yourself as anyone=E2=80=
=99s idea of beauty: think how that shapes the way you see yourself and you=
r entire future.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Steven Kolb, the CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, rec=
alls that when he was introduced to Chavarria, he was first struck by his e=
xperience with other commercial brands, an important element in a field tha=
t tends to attract creative people with no business experience. It was only=
 after Kolb invited the designer to show under the CFDA=E2=80=99s big tent =
in 2015, soon after Chavarria went into business for himself, that he under=
stood his true mettle.</p>
<p>Kolb=E2=80=99s decision was to prove controversial, as he soon found, wh=
en the designer mounted shows featuring models of all genders or none in pa=
rticular, well before such castings had become routine industry practice; s=
howed his work on models in cages built to symbolize the plight of border d=
etainees; and cast immigrants without legal status to walk the runway in hi=
s shows.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhat struck me, though, was that Willy=E2=80=99s commitment to =
culture and cause or purpose was equally or if not of greater importance to=
 him than commercial success,=E2=80=9D Kolb said. =E2=80=9CHis purpose is s=
tanding for something beside the clothes. Sometimes when you hear that from=
 designers, it doesn=E2=80=99t feel authentic. It feels like marketing. But=
 that is not the case with him.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
This above all is why having someone like Chavarria step into =E2=80=9Csuch=
 a huge role=E2=80=9D at one of the most widely distributed and potentially=
 influential labels in the world is so significant, Stokes explained.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt is a giant step in the direction of making sure that people =
are seen. That is a huge thing, though keep in mind it=E2=80=99s not the on=
ly thing. Consumers don=E2=80=99t only want to be =E2=80=98seen=E2=80=99 in=
 some marketing sense. They want to feel as if they are actually being cons=
idered.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
The ability to deliver on that notion is what Chavarria found most =E2=80=
=9Cmagical=E2=80=9D about being offered a top job at Calvin Klein. =E2=80=
=9CWhen you think about how Calvin Klein succeeded, what was it?=E2=80=9D h=
e said. =E2=80=9CSure, he made sales, but his real genius was understanding=
 image and how to include people in something that took them beyond themsel=
ves.=E2=80=9D

<p><p></p><p>In 2015, the Census Bureau published a report projecting that =
by 2044, the United States' white majority would become merely a white plur=
ality: immigration and fertility trends would lead to America's ethnic and =
racial minorities outnumbering its white population.</p><p>Since then, for =
a certain subset of Americans, each annual release by the bureau -- neutral=
, nonpartisan researchers who produce deliberately staid reports -- has bec=
ome a sort of countdown to the white apocalypse. Worse, we now talk about c=
ross-racial fertility rates Darwinistically, as if the census were monitori=
ng a population of elephant seals in competition for a rookery.</p><p>In a =
country whose history has been shaped by the boundaries among racial groups=
, this projected demographic shift is undoubtedly important. Given the raci=
alized nature of our political parties, it also has electoral consequences.=
 However, if we are to overcome the division that defined our past, we must=
 stop reinforcing the salience of those boundaries in the future.</p><p>I a=
m not arguing that the Census Bureau should stop collecting this valuable d=
ata, =C3=A0 la France's farcical attempt to be secular and race blind. Rath=
er, I am arguing that we should place far less stock in the importance of t=
he results to the future of our country. There is no future in which white =
people disappear from America, but there is also no future in which the und=
erstanding of whiteness stays the same.</p><p>The truth is, just as populat=
ions in the United States ebb and flow, the salience of racial and ethnic i=
dentities emerges and disappears. From 1845 to 1854, an influx of Irish peo=
ple arrived on the East Coast that outnumbered immigrants from all other co=
untries since 1776 combined. The resulting backlash created a wave of suppo=
rt for the xenophobic Know Nothing movement and its nativist American Party=
. Today, of course, being Irish is a social boundary mostly reduced to the =
front of Urban Outfitters T-shirts.</p><p>Our history shows that America's =
demographic boundaries evolve with the country's composition. No group goes=
 extinct or disappears; it just gets absorbed into new ways that people def=
ine community and feel belonging.</p><p>Around the turn of the 20th century=
, American leaders began to recognize the accumulating effects of immigrati=
on and civil rights. After the arrival of millions of Irish, the 15th Amend=
ment enfranchised millions of African American men in 1870. And in subseque=
nt decades, the United States admitted millions of Italians, Jews and other=
 ethnicities, with their foreign languages, religions and complexions. Ther=
e was a gradual realization that the Anglo-Protestant orientation of whiten=
ess was unlikely to sustain a dominant majority indefinitely.</p><p>Soon to=
 win the White House, Theodore Roosevelt found these developments alarming.=
 With much of the &quot;competition between the races reducing itself to th=
e warfare of the cradle,&quot; he wrote in 1894, &quot;no race has any chan=
ce to win a great place unless it consists of good breeders as well as of g=
ood fighters.&quot;</p><p>But by the time America's initial &quot;majority =
minority&quot; milestone would have been reached, whiteness had been reinte=
rpreted to incorporate the Irish, Italians, Jews and Slavs, such that the m=
ilestone was effectively postponed. The country broadened the definition of=
 white people enough to maintain power over African Americans and Asian peo=
ple (and later Hispanics).</p><p>It is possible that we are now in the proc=
ess of similarly altering our conception of whiteness again. Many Hispanics=
 identify as white, and marriages between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites=
 make up more than 40 percent of recent interracial marriages. That may be =
enough to artificially postpone America's majority minority milestone again=
 and reassure the millions of &quot;white&quot; Americans who feel threaten=
ed by the increasing status and power of today's ethnic minorities.</p><p>S=
toking fears of white decline reinforces the myth that this whiteness alway=
s included all who now identify with it -- as if the Irish had never been d=
emonized, as if Italians had never endured discrimination, as if Jews had n=
ever been excluded. Through a historical lens, being white in America today=
 is like belonging to a once-exclusive social club that had to loosen its m=
embership criteria to stay afloat.</p><p>Because of the status white people=
 retain in American society, a degree of privilege and belonging still awai=
ts those who can claim it. People who identify as white hold disproportiona=
te power and resources today, and this pernicious reality seems unlikely to=
 change even if white people do become a 49 percent plurality in about two =
decades. And there is precious little evidence of real solidarity among Ame=
rica's diverse minority ethnic groups. So a 51 percent pan-minority share i=
s unlikely to yield any new majority status without a new pan-ethnic sense =
of community.</p><p>Despite his susceptibility to eugenics and racial theor=
ies of supremacy, Roosevelt also offers us a way forward. His American nati=
onalism was defiantly civic -- rather than only ethnic or racial -- in natu=
re.</p><p>In his narrative histories published from 1885 to 1894, Roosevelt=
 argued that as European immigrants were assimilated, their heritages were =
being absorbed into the American body, fusing Americans into a single peopl=
e forged in the &quot;crucible&quot; of the frontier. The acts of claiming =
and developing land and defending it against the forces of nature all const=
ituted rites of passage that transformed foreigners into Americans.</p><p>I=
n Roosevelt's understanding, Americans were born through no document; they =
were made by their encounters with the wilderness and their cultivation of =
strength, individualism and democratic community -- their commitment to a s=
et of principles. For him, the new ethnicities admitted into the United Sta=
tes were not entitled to their American identity; it was to be earned.</p><=
p>There is no frontier anymore, but the grind of modern capitalism is just =
as stern a forge for fashioning American identity. In counting the American=
 people, the Census Bureau may distinguish between Black, white, Asian and =
Hispanic, but it indiscriminately recognizes them all as fellow Americans -=
- as people who count and therefore must be counted.</p><p>And even if the =
Census Bureau's categories reinforce the racial boundaries that too often d=
ivide American society, these categories are also starting to show signs of=
 their mutability. Underreported, the number of mixed-race Americans increa=
sed nearly threefold in the past decade alone; 80 percent of intermarriages=
 in the United States today unite non-Hispanic white partners with members =
of an ethnic or a racial minority.</p><p>Older generations may still be foc=
used on century-old divisions, but younger Americans are starting to blur t=
hem. Future Americans will identify with new communities. May they be as br=
oad and inclusive as possible.</p><p>Justin Gest (@_JustinGest) is an assoc=

e country have grown more diverse. A design change in the census form also =
allowed the government to report people's identity in greater detail.</p><p=
>WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau released a surprising finding this week: T=
he number of non-Hispanic Americans who identify as multiracial had jumped =
by 127 percent over the decade. For people who identified as Hispanic, the =
increase was even higher.</p><p>The spike sent demographers scrambling. Was=
 the reason simply that more multiracial babies were being born? Or that Am=
ericans were rethinking their identities? Or had a design change in this ye=
ar's census form caused the sudden, unexpected shift?</p><p>The answer, it =
seems, is all of the above.</p><p>Multiracial Americans are still a relativ=
ely small part of the population -- just 4 percent -- but the increase over=
 the decade was substantial and, the data shows, often surprising in its ge=
ography. The number of Americans who identified as non-Hispanic and more th=
an one race jumped to 13.5 million from 6 million. The largest increase in =
non-Hispanic Americans of two or more races was in Oklahoma, followed by Al=
aska and Arkansas.</p><p>Americans who were mixed race recorded a wide rang=
e of identities. People who identified themselves as both white and Asian m=
ade up about 18 percent of the total number of non-Hispanic multiracial Ame=
ricans in 2020. Those who reported their race as both white and Black accou=
nted for 20.5 percent. Americans who were both white and Native American we=
re 26 percent of the total, according to Andrew Beveridge, who founded Soci=
al Explorer, a data analytics company.</p><p>Part of the rise in people ide=
ntifying as multiracial was simply the growing diversity of the American po=
pulation. As the newest immigrants, largely from Asia and Latin America, ha=
ve children and grandchildren, and those Americans form families, they are =
much more likely to marry outside their racial or ethnic groups than their =
parents were. Among newlywed Hispanic people who were born in the United St=
ates, about 39 percent marry someone who is not Hispanic, according to the =
Pew Research Center. For Asian people, that number is about the same.</p><p=
>But the increase can also be attributed in part to changing ways in which =
Americans identify themselves -- and the ways the government categorizes th=
em.</p><p>Census categories are complicated, because race and its boundarie=
s change over time based on shifts in culture and society. Some argue the c=
ensus can leave the impression that race is a fixed, naturally occurring ca=
tegory that can be neatly counted. Until 2000, the Census Bureau only recog=
nized one response for race.</p><p>For Michael Watson, 38, the son of a Jam=
aican mother and a Puerto Rican father of Scottish and Bajan descent, one b=
ox was not enough.</p><p>&quot;A lot of times you are painted in a box wher=
e you have to choose,&quot; said Mr. Watson, of the Bronx, who is director =
of an analytics company and co-founder of a digital media company. &quot;Bu=
t as a Black man, I felt uncomfortable having to feel as if I had to pick b=
etween both sides.&quot;</p><p>For the 2020 census, officials tried to more=
 accurately capture the profusion of complexity in American demographics.</=
p><p>Last year's census form differed substantially from the one in 2010, R=
achel Marks, chief of the racial statistics branch at the Census Bureau, sa=
id in an interview. Lines were added under the boxes for Black and for whit=
e, where respondents could describe in more nuance their racial backgrounds=
. Coding capacity improved too, capturing far more detail in people's writt=
en answers than before.</p><p>Some of those changes, she said, contributed =
to the rise in the numbers of people who identified as more than one race -=
- though precisely what share, she could not say.</p><p>&quot;It's not just=
 one thing,&quot; Ms. Marks said in an interview on Friday. &quot;We improv=
ed the questions. There were new write-in lines. All in addition to the way=
s that we processed and coded the data.&quot;</p><p>Demographic change was =
a factor too, though she said it was impossible to say how much of the dram=
atic growth it accounted for. Asked whether part of the decline in the numb=
er of people who identified as non-Hispanic white was related to the change=
s in the form, Ms. Marks said she could not &quot;say for sure one way or a=
nother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're still digging into the data,&quot; she said=
. &quot;I think these improvements and changes could have also contributed =
to that. But it's certainly a trend we've been seeing for the past several =
decades.&quot;</p><p>The result was a much more nuanced -- and accurate -- =
portrait of how Americans see themselves, social scientists said, even if p=
art of the spike in the multiracial category was as much about reclassifica=
tion as it was about real growth.</p><p>Richard Alba, a sociologist who has=
 written about race categorization and the census, said that typically, a l=
arge share of Hispanic Americans check the box for white in the race questi=
on. Now, he said, they were given the chance to describe their backgrounds =
more fully, an addition, he said, that could have flipped them into the mul=
tiracial category.</p><p>&quot;That's not a change in social reality, that'=
s a change in the way social reality is being categorized,&quot; he said. &=
quot;In the long run we will probably be able to say more precisely to what=
 extent is there a real change and to what extent is this a coding change.&=
quot;</p><p>However, the coding change was not simply a statistical blip. I=
t was a meaningful widening of options people had to say who they felt they=
 were.</p><p>For Mr. Watson, the fact that more Americans were identifying =
themselves as multiracial felt like a recognition by society that he had lo=
ng craved.</p><p>&quot;I think it shows that there's more depth and breadth=
 to us as people of color,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a testament that our s=
ociety is moving in the right direction. It goes beyond just the color of o=
ur skin.&quot;</p><p>Ruby Herrera, 28, can testify to the frustration of be=
ing asked to fit herself neatly into just one racial category. She remember=
s feeling different from most other children when she was in grade school a=
nd had to fill out a form indicating her identity.</p><p>Ms. Herrera's moth=
er is white, from Wisconsin, and her father is from Mexico. She loved speak=
ing two languages and knowing that she belonged to two cultures.</p><p>But =
her teacher advised her to just pick one.</p><p>&quot;For me as a 7-year-ol=
d kid, I was like I can't just pick one,&quot; she said. &quot;What do you =
mean? Which one do I pick? If I pick one, does that mean I'm not the other?=
 None of my classmates understood why I was so upset.&quot;</p><p>Ms. Herre=
ra and Taylor Clarkson, friends from college, created an online community c=
alled Mixed Millennial to bring people of multiracial backgrounds together =
to share experiences.</p><p>As the children and grandchildren of recent imm=
igrants from Asia and Latin America start families of their own, racial cat=
egories in America have again become fluid.</p><p>One of the big demographi=
c questions, social scientists said, is what will become of the categories.=
 Particularly salient, they say, is that of white. The declining share of w=
hite people as a part of the population has become a part of American polit=
ics -- as a worry on the right and a cause for optimism on the left.</p><p>=
But while white people have long been at the top of the American social hie=
rarchy, and the category has expanded over time to include the immigrants f=
rom Southern and Eastern Europe who came at the turn of the last century, t=
he profusion of identities in American society and their growing acceptance=
 is raising the question of how much social power whiteness still holds.</p=
><p>&quot;To me the interesting story is not the decline of white people as=
 a supposed group but the historical advantages of whiteness and how they m=
ay be changing,&quot; said Charles King, a political scientist at Georgetow=
n University. &quot;With the greater power and visibility of people who fee=
l they fit uneasily inside the old census boxes, it's possible to claim a r=
ange of identities without feeling you're harming your chances of success i=
n American society.&quot;</p><p>The one group that was never allowed to cro=
ss the line into whiteness, African Americans, may not have as many options=
.</p><p>&quot;The whole racial classification system is going to shift in t=
he next few years,&quot; said Douglas S. Massey, a sociologist at Princeton=
 University. &quot;The off-the-shelf standard American is going to be some =
kind of blend of Asian, Latino and white. The big question always is, how d=
o Blacks fit in.&quot;</p><p>Kori Alexis Trataros, a school counselor in th=
e South Bronx, said that she sees hope in the younger generation being more=
 open and accepting of interracial couples and multiracial children.</p><p>=
&quot;Our generation is so great at having open conversation and is willing=
 to unlearn certain things that we were taught when we were younger,&quot; =
said Ms. Trataros, 30, whose father was Greek and mother is Jamaican.</p><p=
>She remembers not being able to date a white boy she liked in high school =
because he wasn't allowed to bring home a Black girl. But she thinks there'=
s less of that kind of pressure on teens of all races today. And access to =
social media, she said, has made it easier for biracial and multiracial peo=
ple to see others who look like them, to claim their identities with pride =
and to connect with one another.</p><p>Ms. Trataros said that though her pa=
rents were loving and supportive, talking about race and social justice was=
 a taboo in her broader family, which sometimes made her feel like an outsi=
der in her own family.</p><p>In recent years she has distanced herself from=
 some white family members who aren't willing to engage in conversations ab=
out racism and social justice.</p><p>&quot;It hurts,&quot; she said, &quot;=
but I'm not surprised at the same time.&quot;</p><p>Charlie Smart contribut=

ntially over the past decade, but the number of multiracial Americans more =
than doubled.</p><p>The United States grew significantly more diverse over =
the past decade, as the populations of people who identify as Hispanic and =
Asian surged and the number of people who said they were more than one race=
 more than doubled, the Census Bureau reported on Thursday.</p><p>Overall p=
opulation growth slowed substantially over the past decade, but the growth =
that did occur -- an increase of about 23 million people -- was made up ent=
irely of people who identified as Hispanic, Asian, Black and more than one =
race, according to the data, the first racial and ethnic breakdown from the=
 2020 census.</p><p>The white population declined for the first time in his=
tory. People who identify themselves as white on the census form have been =
decreasing as a share of the country's population since the 1960s, when the=
 United States lifted strict ethnic quotas aimed at keeping the country Nor=
thern and Western European.</p><p>That drop, of 2.6 percent, was driven in =
part by the aging of the white population -- the median age was 44 in 2019,=
 compared with 30 for Hispanics -- and a long-running decline in the birthr=
ate. Some social scientists theorized that another potential reason for the=
 decrease was that more Americans who previously identified as white on the=
 census are now choosing more than one race.</p><p>The single biggest popul=
ation increase was among people who identified as more than one race, a cat=
egory that first appeared on census forms 20 years ago, and now is the fast=
est-growing racial and ethnic category.</p><p>People who identify as white =
now make up 58 percent of the population, down from 64 percent in 2010, and=
 69 percent in 2000.</p><p>&quot;We are in a weird time demographically,&qu=
ot; said Tom=C3=A1s Jim=C3=A9nez, a sociologist at Stanford University who =
writes about immigrants, assimilation and social mobility. &quot;There's mo=
re choice about our individual identities and how we present them than ther=
e has ever been. We can presume far less about who somebody is based on the=
 boxes they check compared to previous periods.&quot;</p><p>The data also s=
howed that just under a majority of people under the age of 18 checked boxe=
s other than white -- multirace, Hispanic, Asian, or Black -- a milestone t=
hat is the result of a substantially more diverse younger American populati=
on. A decade ago, 65 percent of children were white. Overall, the number of=
 Americans under the age of 18 declined, partly an effect of the drop in th=
e birthrate, according to William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings =
Institution.</p><p>Thursday's numbers provide this census' first picture of=
 changes in the American population below the level of states.</p><p>The fi=
ve largest cities in the country are now New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Ho=
uston and Phoenix. Philadelphia is now the sixth largest city, bumped from =
fifth by Phoenix, which was the fastest growing of the top 10 largest citie=
s. Its population rose by 11.2 percent.</p><p>The Villages, a retirement co=
mmunity in Florida, was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the countr=
y over the decade.</p><p>The data, charting which parts of the country have=
 seen growth and decline, have a practical use in politics. They are the ba=
sis for redistricting, a process in which state legislatures redraw voting =
lines based on changes in their states' populations.</p><p>The new data sho=
w that Hispanics accounted for about half the country's growth over the pas=
t decade, up by about 23 percent. The Asian population grew faster than exp=
ected -- up by about 36 percent, a rise that made up nearly a fifth of the =
country's total. Nearly one in four Americans now identifies as either Hisp=
anic or Asian. The Black population grew by 6 percent, an increase that rep=
resented about a tenth of the country's growth. Americans who identified as=
 non-Hispanic and more than one race rose the fastest, jumping to 13.5 mill=
ion from 6 million.</p><p>And in what appears to be a big shift in how Hisp=
anics think of their racial identity, one third of Hispanics reported being=
 more than one race, up from just 6 percent in 2010. That means that Hispan=
ics are now nearly twice as likely to identify as multiracial than as white=
.</p><p>Hispanic origin is counted as an ethnicity, and is a distinct categ=
ory from race. But Hispanics can also check race boxes.</p><p>Richard Alba,=
 a sociologist who has studied demographics and the fluidity of racial cate=
gories, said the rise in multiracial Americans was a logical extension of t=
he substantial mixing that has been happening for years in the United State=
s.</p><p>Among Asians and Hispanics, more than a quarter marry outside thei=
r race, according to the Pew Research Center. For American-born Asians, the=
 share is nearly double that.</p><p>The jump in the multirace category is p=
artly to do with the Census Bureau collecting more detailed data, Professor=
 Alba said, and analyzing answers more deeply. He said he believed that par=
t of the decrease in the white population was people switching from the cat=
egory of white to the category of more than one race.</p><p>&quot;The censu=
s is doing a much better job at reflecting the growing complexity of the po=
pulation,&quot; he said. &quot;They are really trying to acknowledge that t=
he world is changing out there.&quot;</p><p>The nation has been growing mor=
e diverse for decades, but recently the pace has accelerated. Non-Hispanic =
white people accounted for 46 percent of population growth in the 1970s, 36=
 percent in the 1980s, 20 percent in the 1990s, but just 8 percent of the g=
rowth in the first decade of this century and now zero in the 2010s.</p><p>=
Immigration is a force that has bolstered the American population, and boos=
ted the economy, bringing a younger work force that is helping support a gr=
owing older population.</p><p>Despite the dramatic slowdown in immigration =
at the end of the decade, the proportion of U.S. residents born in foreign =
countries is still at its highest point since the last big immigration wave=
 around the turn of the 20th century.</p><p>Immigrants who have arrived in =
more recent years have largely been from countries in Asia and Latin Americ=
a and have tended to settle in large cities, like New York and Los Angeles.=
</p><p>But over time, Hispanic and Asian immigrants and their children have=
 fanned out broadly across the country, to smaller towns and rural areas.</=
p><p>That migration has helped support the numbers of people in rural place=
s: Over the past decade, rural places lost both Black and white residents -=
- their populations in those places each dropped by about five percent -- b=
ut the numbers of people who identify as Hispanic and Asian continued to ri=
se. In 2000, Hispanic and Asian residents made up just 6 percent of the rur=
al population. Now it's nearly 10 percent.</p><p>But that increase was not =
enough to stem the tide out of rural places, which ultimately lost populati=
on over the decade, a change from the previous decade, when rural places ma=
de modest gains.</p><p>The biggest winners in population growth were suburb=
s and retirement communities in the South and the West. In counties conside=
red to be retirement destinations, the population jumped by 17 percent.</p>=
<p>Industrial cities in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions saw the bigges=
t population losses, places such as Saginaw, Flint and Detroit in Michigan;=
 Gary, Ind.; and Youngstown, Ohio.</p><p>The counties that have changed the=
 most demographically over the past decade tended to be places that started=
 out overwhelmingly white. Counties like Luzerne in Pennsylvania and Forsyt=
he in Georgia are among the biggest gainers of diversity since 2010. Also h=
igh on the list are two counties in North Dakota, Cass and Ward, and Living=
ston Parish in Louisiana.</p><p>Now, about 98 percent of Americans live in =
a county with an increasing number of Latinos, and 95 percent live in a cou=
nty where the Asian population is on the rise. Diversity is rising in 19 ou=
t of every 20 counties.</p><p>Still, growth slowed dramatically, even for H=
ispanics and Asians, driven in part by declining birthrates, as well as a d=
rop in immigration. For example, the population of Asian people grew at jus=
t half the rate of the previous decade, when it rose by about 43 percent. G=
rowth in the Hispanic population had an even steeper decline.</p><p>Growth =
in the Black population slowed too, but was still broad. All but nine state=
s gained Black residents and the Black share of the population went up in 3=
2 states. While half the nation's population growth occurred in the South, =
70 percent of Black population growth occurred in those states. The vast ma=
jority of the Black population growth was suburban. It increased by 6 perce=
nt overall but 12 percent in suburban neighborhoods.</p><p>And in a new twi=
st likely to draw demographers' attention, the Black population fell in Bla=
ck-majority neighborhoods but rose in neighborhoods where Black people made=
 up less than 10 percent of the population.</p><p>The white population may =
have declined nationally, but it grew in certain parts of the country. As i=
n previous decades, the vast majority of white population growth occurred i=
n neighborhoods that were mostly white to begin with -- largely exurbs at t=
he outer edges of metro areas.</p><p>Nearly three dozen states lost white p=
opulation and all but the District of Columbia, which is treated as a state=
 for statistical purposes, saw the share of white residents drop.</p><p>Rac=
e may be socially constructed but the understanding of it has important pol=
itical effects. One change that has been politically resonant has been the =
shrinking share of the white population, with the right seeing the shift as=
 a threat and the left celebrating it as a kind of demographic destiny in w=
hich growing numbers of people of color will vote for Democrats.</p><p>Prof=
essor Jim=C3=A9nez, whose county, Santa Clara, in California, became minori=
ty white more than 20 years ago, said these two views are most common among=
 highly politicized Americans, and that most people don't notice diversity.=
</p><p>&quot;You go to places that have been majority-minority for a long t=
ime and the diversity is banal -- it's not like everyone has bumper sticker=
s saying celebrate diversity,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not something they =
celebrate or panic over. It's mostly just a fact of life.&quot;</p><div><st=

<p>The United States grew significantly more diverse over the past decade, =
as the populations of people who identify as Hispanic and Asian surged and =
the number of people who said they were more than one race increased, the C=
ensus Bureau reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Overall population growth slowed dramatically over the past decade. The =
growth that did occur =E2=80=94 an increase of about 23 million people =E2=
=80=94 was made up entirely of people who identified as Hispanic, Asian, Bl=
ack and more than one race, according to the data, the first racial and eth=
nic breakdown from the 2020 census.</p>
<p>The white population in the United States, for the first time on record,=
 declined over the course of the decade. People who identify themselves as =
white on the census form have been decreasing as a share of the country=E2=
=80=99s population since the 1960s, when the United States opened up more w=
idely to immigrants from outside Europe.</p>
<p>That drop was driven in part by the aging of the white population and a =
sharp drop in the birthrate.</p>
<p>The single biggest increase was among people who identified as more than=
 one race, a category that first appeared on census forms 20 years ago and =
now is the fastest growing racial and ethnic category. That population more=
 than doubled.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe are in a weird time demographically,=E2=80=9D said Tom=C3=A1=
s Jim=C3=A9nez, a sociologist at Stanford who writes about immigrants, assi=
milation and social mobility. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s more choice about ou=
r individual identities and how we present them than there has ever been. W=
e can presume far less about who somebody is based on the boxes they check =
compared to previous periods.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Thursday=E2=80=99s numbers are this census=E2=80=99s first picture of ch=
anges in the U.S. population below the level of states.</p>
<p>The top five largest cities in the country are New York, Los Angeles, Ch=
icago, Houston and Phoenix. Philadelphia is now the sixth-largest city, bum=
ped from fifth by Phoenix, which was the fastest growing of the top 20 larg=
est cities. Its population rose by 9.4%.</p>
<p>The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, was the fastest-growing=
 metropolitan area in the country. And McKenzie County, North Dakota, was t=
he fastest-growing county over the past decade. Its population more than do=
ubled.</p>
<p>The data, which offers the most detailed picture of race in America sinc=
e the last decennial census in 2010, is the basis for redistricting, a proc=
ess in which state legislatures redraw voting lines based on changes in the=
ir states=E2=80=99 populations.</p>
<p>The increase in the numbers of people who identify as Asian and Hispanic=
 was less dramatic than in previous decades but still much more robust than=
 the increase in the number of Americans who checked the box for white or B=
lack.</p>
<p>The data shows that Hispanics accounted for about half the country=E2=80=
=99s growth over the past decade, up by about 23%. The Asian population gre=
w faster than expected =E2=80=94 up by about 36%, a rise that made up nearl=
y one-fifth of the country=E2=80=99s growth.</p>
<p>Nearly 1 in 4 Americans identify themselves as either Hispanic or Asian.=
 The Black population grew by 6%, an increase that represented about one-te=
nth of the country=E2=80=99s growth. Americans who identified as non-Hispan=
ic and more than one race rose the fastest, jumping to 13.5 million from 6 =
million.</p>
<p>And in what appears to be a big shift in how Hispanics think of their ra=
cial identity, one-third of Hispanics reported being more than one race, up=
 from 6% in 2010. That means that Hispanics are now nearly twice as likely =
to identify as multiracial than as white.</p>
<p>Hispanic origin is counted as an ethnicity and is a distinct category fr=
om race. But Hispanics can also check race boxes.</p>
<p>The nation has been growing more diverse for decades, but recently the p=
ace has accelerated. Non-Hispanic white people accounted for 46% of populat=
ion growth in the 1970s, 36% in the 1980s and 20% in the 1990s but just 8% =
of the growth in the first decade of this century and zero in the 2010s.</p=
>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis is a pivotal moment for the country in terms of its divers=
ity,=E2=80=9D said William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institu=
tion. =E2=80=9CPart of our population is aging and slow growing. To counter=
 that, we have people of color who are younger and growing more rapidly. Th=
ey are helping to propel us further into a century where diversity is going=
 to be the signature of our demography.=E2=80=9D

<p>BENTONVILLE, Ark. =E2=80=94 Northwest Arkansas, where the Ozark Mountain=
s rise, used to be a sleepy corner of the state, its only claim to fame tha=
t Sam Walton opened a five-and-dime in Bentonville and the first Walmart st=
ore in nearby Rogers =E2=80=94 outposts that became the seeds of a global r=
etail empire. The founders of Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt got their start in =
the same region, and a network of software companies moved in later to meet=
 big business=E2=80=99s insatiable appetite for new technology.</p>
<p>But there were not enough locals to build the burgeoning economy. Answer=
ing the call to work in poultry production, trucking, construction and comp=
uter programming were legions of immigrants from El Salvador, the Marshall =
Islands, Mexico, India and elsewhere.</p>
<p>With tens of thousands of immigrants helping to catalyze its development=
, Northwest Arkansas has emerged as one of the country=E2=80=99s fastest-gr=
owing metropolitan areas. Brimming with optimism, it is wooing newcomers wi=
th cheaper housing, a world-class art museum, upscale restaurants and fores=
ted bike trails.</p>
<p>But as much of the U.S. economy comes back from the coronavirus pandemic=
, the decadeslong influx of immigrants that fueled such enormous expansion =
in places like Arkansas has begun to stall, posing challenges to the region=
 and the country at large.</p>
<p>The United States over the past 10 years experienced the slowest populat=
ion growth rate in eight decades, according to the 2020 census, because of =
plunging fertility rates and shrinking immigration.</p>
<p>The surge of migrants in the country illegally from Mexico and Central A=
merica is testing the Biden administration, but images are deceptive: A vas=
t majority of the single adults crossing the border to find work are quickl=
y deported. And the flow of legal immigrants, whom Northwest Arkansas compa=
nies also heavily rely on, has fallen precipitously since the Trump adminis=
tration clamped down on all kinds of immigration with the belief that it wa=
s displacing American workers.</p>
<p>Now, business leaders are hoping that President Joe Biden will make good=
 on his pledge to overhaul the immigration system and establish a legal pip=
eline for foreign workers to take jobs in Northwest Arkansas and other plac=
es that depend on them.</p>
<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called on Congress and the White House =
to double the number of visas for high-skilled temporary workers under the =
H-1B program and also for seasonal workers in sectors like agriculture and =
meat production, another economic mainstay in this part of the country.</p>
<p>Lifting the ceiling on H-1B visas has been contentious, with some labor =
groups arguing that foreign workers imported from places like India and Chi=
na displace Americans and drive down wages.</p>
<p>So far, Biden has concentrated on the surge of immigrants at the southwe=
stern border, and has not advanced measures to bring large numbers of new w=
orkers into the country.
</p><p>
=E2=80=9CIn addition to securing the border, we should be focusing on how t=
o secure avenues for more legal immigration,=E2=80=9D said Neil Bradley, ch=
ief policy officer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. =E2=80=9CFor a whole h=
ost of communities all across the United States, immigration will determine=
 whether the local economy will continue to grow for those moving there and=
 the residents who have called that place home for decades.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The decline in immigration is an important factor in the long-term decli=
ne in population growth that demographers are forecasting in the United Sta=
tes.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen you are not going to have enough births =E2=80=94 and deat=
hs will continue with an aging population =E2=80=94 the only variable that =
can make an appreciable difference is immigration,=E2=80=9D said Joseph Cha=
mie, a demographer who formerly headed the United Nations division on popul=
ation.</p>
<p>Areas such as Northwest Arkansas can =E2=80=9Cforget about=E2=80=9D cont=
inued growth, Chamie said, without the steady arrival of new immigrants.</p=
>
<p>
The Census Bureau had projected that the number of immigrants in the United=
 States would increase by 1.4 million from July 2017 to July 2019. Instead,=
 it climbed by a net 400,000.</p>
<p>In Northwest Arkansas, 1,750 foreign newcomers arrived in 2016, accounti=
ng for more than 14% of all new residents, according to the census. In 2019=
, only 750 new immigrants settled in the area.</p>
<p>The drop comes as employers in the region =E2=80=94 like many across the=
 country =E2=80=94 are also facing an intense labor shortage from the pande=
mic. Homebuilders, hospitals and technology companies are all struggling to=
 find workers. Poultry processors have been offering higher hourly rates as=
 well as attendance, referral and sign-on bonuses.</p>
<p>Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt, a transportation and logistics giant, are pos=
ting for workers to take unfilled tech jobs.</p>
<p>Jared Smith, CEO of Kitestring, a boutique technology company that serve=
s retailers, has been trying for months to fill 30 jobs.</p>
<p>The firm pays six-figure salaries for software engineers. =E2=80=9CThe b=
attle for talent has become even fiercer,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
<p>About 35% of his 175 employees are on H-1B visas. =E2=80=9CIf I were to =
depend exclusively on U.S. citizens, it=E2=80=99s hard to imagine I would g=
row,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
<p>Immigrants have transformed the area not just culturally, but politicall=
y as well.</p>
<p>As of the 1990 census, Northwest Arkansas was 95% white. But by 2019, th=
at figure had dropped to 72%, thanks to immigration. In Bentonville, 15.5% =
of the population was foreign born by then, and in Springdale, the state=E2=
=80=99s poultry center, 37.6% of the population was Hispanic.</p>
<p>Springdale voters in November sent the first Latino to the City Council,=
 Kevin Flores, the son of a poultry worker; Bentonville elected the first I=
ndian American, Gayatri Agnew, to the City Council. Even in the state=E2=80=
=99s Republican-majority Legislature, there has been recognition of the rol=
e of immigrant labor. This year the General Assembly passed a bill to enabl=
e immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, often k=
nown as =E2=80=9CDreamers,=E2=80=9D to obtain any professional or occupatio=
nal license, one of the most liberal such laws in the country.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe have a fast-growing economy, and we are concerned about a la=
bor shortage,=E2=80=9D said Nelson Peacock, who heads the Northwest Arkansa=
s Council, founded by major employers in the region to promote economic dev=
elopment. =E2=80=9CWe need workers of all skill levels, and immigrants are =
an important part of the equation.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Baaju Chepuri remembers vividly the Bentonville he encountered in 2008, =
when he accepted a job to work as a software engineer for Walmart.</p>
<p>On the drive into town from the regional airport, he felt like a city bo=
y lost in the woods. The Indian community was minuscule. To stock up on Ind=
ian groceries, eat at Indian restaurants and watch Bollywood movies, they j=
ourneyed to Kansas City, Missouri, or Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis place was 20% of what it is today,=E2=80=9D Chepuri said. =
=E2=80=9CThere was literally nothing to do.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Bentonville=E2=80=99s Indian population grew by 361% between 2010-19. By=
 then, there were Indian cafes and supermarkets dotting strip malls. A glea=
ming Hindu temple opened for worship in 2012, and the city is erecting two =
cricket pitches for the 25-team local league.
</p><p>
Less than 20 miles south of Bentonville along Interstate 49, immigrants als=
o transformed Springdale, the center of the state=E2=80=99s multibillion-do=
llar poultry industry, as tens of thousands of Latin Americans, both legal =
residents and those in the country illegally, arrived.</p>
<p>Hispanic-owned groceries, bakeries and car repair shops popped up on Tho=
mpson Street. At Murphy Park, Hispanic families grilled carne asada and cel=
ebrated birthdays with pi=C3=B1atas.</p>
<p>Families from the Marshall Islands also arrived. Arkansas certified the =
nation=E2=80=99s first Marshallese court interpreter in Springdale, and a M=
arshallese consulate opened its doors.</p>
<p>
The immigrants have not found a universal welcome.</p>
<p>Unease prevails among some longtime residents, like Debbie Eden, a busin=
ess owner in Springdale. =E2=80=9CMany immigrants are hard workers,=E2=80=
=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cbut they come in and undercut you working for less m=
oney.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>For the immigrants who have arrived, the region=E2=80=99s boom has led t=
o ample employment.</p>
<p>Ershad Ismail Gani, who came five years ago from India and now works at =
Kitestring developing software that runs cash registers at Sam=E2=80=99s Cl=
ub and Walmart, said that several of his friends have been hired away by ot=
her employers scrambling for workers, and that he had also been approached.=
</p>
<p>Wages have been high enough that he and his wife have welcomed a daughte=
r into their family and bought a four-bedroom house with a home theater. =
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s really amazing how many jobs are available,=E2=80=9D =
Gani said. =E2=80=9CEverywhere I turn there are opportunities.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
In Springdale, Yanira Umana, a wing cutter at a Simmons Foods turkey plant =
who is an immigrant from El Salvador, showed off the tidy three-bedroom bri=
ck house =E2=80=94 with a flower garden in full bloom =E2=80=94 that she re=
cently acquired.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI achieved all this working with chicken and turkey,=E2=80=9D s=
aid Umana, a single mother of two.</p>
<p>But she is raising her American daughters, 9 and 12, to have loftier amb=
itions. =E2=80=9CDay after day, I tell them this is not the life I want for=
 you,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>Older immigrants, like American baby boomers, are not being replaced by =
their children. And while immigrants illegally crossing the southwestern bo=
rder may be willing to take unforgiving jobs, they are not a hiring option =
for big-name companies like those in Northwest Arkansas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legal workers are graying.</p>
<p>When Marta Merlos of El Salvador moved there in 1995 to work on Tyson=E2=
=80=99s lines, her son, then in the first grade, was one of only 10 Latino =
children at Robert E. Lee Elementary.</p>
<p>Merlos, 61, who is now a U.S. citizen, still endures 12-hour shifts. The=
 middle finger on her right hand is deformed, and she feels body aches at t=
he end of each day.</p>
<p>But it has paid off, she said.</p>
<p>Her oldest son, Kevin Flores, joined the Marines, then went to college a=
nd became a lawyer. In November, with a campaign touting him as a product o=
f the new, diverse Springdale, he became the first Latino elected to the Ci=
ty Council.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe makeup of Northwest Arkansas has changed dramatically thank=
s to immigrants, and we are much better off because of them,=E2=80=9D said =
Flores, 33, who arrived in the United States when he was 3 years old. =E2=
=80=9CTo keep flourishing, the region will need immigrants to continue movi=
ng here.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p>PHOENIX =E2=80=94 Luz Portillo, the oldest daughter of Mexican immigrant=
s, has many plans. She is studying to be a skin care expert. She has also a=
pplied to nursing school. She works full time, too =E2=80=94 as a nurse=E2=
=80=99s aide and doing eyelash extensions, a business she would like to gro=
w.</p>
<p>But one thing she has no plans for anytime soon is a baby.</p>
<p>Portillo=E2=80=99s mother had her when she was 16. Her father has worked=
 as a landscaper for as long as she can remember. She wants a career and mo=
re control over her life.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t get pregnant, I can=E2=80=99t get pregnant,=E2=
=80=9D she said she tells herself. =E2=80=9CI have to have a career and a j=
ob. If I don=E2=80=99t, it=E2=80=99s like everything my parents did goes in=
 vain.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>For decades, delaying parenthood was the domain of upper-middle-class Am=
ericans, especially in big, coastal cities. Highly educated women put off h=
aving a baby until their careers were on track, often until their early 30s=
. But over the past decade, as more women of all social classes have priori=
tized education and career, delaying childbearing has become a broad patter=
n among American women almost everywhere.</p>
<p>The result has been the slowest growth of the American population since =
the 1930s, and a profound change in American motherhood. Women under 30 hav=
e become much less likely to have children. Since 2007, the birthrate for w=
omen in their 20s has fallen by 28%, and the biggest recent declines have b=
een among unmarried women. The only age groups in which birthrates rose ove=
r that period were women in their 30s and 40s =E2=80=94 but even those bega=
n to decline over the past three years.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe story here is about young women, whose births are plummetin=
g,=E2=80=9D said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who anal=
yzed county-level birth records for The New York Times. =E2=80=9CAll of a s=
udden, in the last 10 years, there=E2=80=99s this tremendous transformation=
.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>A geographic analysis of Myers=E2=80=99 data offers a clue: The birthrat=
e is falling fastest in places with the greatest job growth =E2=80=94 where=
 women have more incentive to wait.</p>
<p>In more than two dozen interviews with young women in Phoenix and Denver=
, some said they felt they could not afford a baby. They cited the costs of=
 child care and housing, and sometimes student debt. Many also said they wa=
nted to get their careers set first and expressed satisfaction that they we=
re exerting control over their fertility =E2=80=94 and their lives =E2=80=
=94 in a way their mothers had not.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI can <i>not</i> have a kid and not have to feel bad about it,=
=E2=80=9D said Eboni McFadden, 28, who grew up in rural Missouri and is now=
 two weeks from graduating as a medical technician in Phoenix. =E2=80=9CI f=
eel powerful that I can make that decision with my own body. I don=E2=80=99=
t have to have a kid to be successful or to be a woman.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The annual fertility rate may be dropping =E2=80=94 births have fallen f=
or six straight years and declined precipitously during the pandemic =E2=80=
=94 but the share of women who have children by the end of their reproducti=
ve years has been climbing. Still, in the past decade, births to women over=
 30 have not offset the decline for women in their 20s, driving down overal=
l births and leaving an open question: Are young women delaying childbirth =
or forgoing it altogether?</p>
<p><b>Child Care Costs, and Opportunity Costs</b>
</p>
<p>The declines in childbearing over the past decade have varied by region,=
 according to the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention =
and the Census Bureau. They were greater on the West Coast and in the Mount=
ain West than in the South or Northeast. The large urban counties that have=
 gained the most jobs and population since the recession have seen birthrat=
es fall twice as fast as smaller, rural counties that have not recovered as=
 strongly. The birthrate fell 38% in Denver County and 33% in Maricopa Coun=
ty, which includes Phoenix.</p>
<p>In economically stagnant places, fertility tends to be higher, and havin=
g a child is seen as a primary route to fulfillment.</p>
<p>Kara Schoenherr moved to Maricopa County, Arizona, from a small town sou=
th of Seattle a few years ago. She was tired of paying $1,500 a month for a=
 house in a town with no stoplight and a drug epidemic. Her friend lived in=
 Phoenix, and she had heard it had lots of good colleges and jobs.</p>
<p>She married last year, but she and her husband, a sous-chef at a casino,=
 have been holding off on having children. She will graduate this summer as=
 an aesthetician, doing things like facials and waxing. But she wants to ha=
ve a base of clients before having a baby.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI still don=E2=80=99t think I have everything I want to set mys=
elf up for success,=E2=80=9D said Schoenherr, 27. =E2=80=9CI want to have a=
 house and a career first.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The cost of living is adding to her hesitation. Houses in areas that she=
 likes sell overnight with dozens of offers. Day-care rates gave her sticke=
r shock.</p>
<p>In interviews with women from immigrant families, almost all of them His=
panic, the delay was less about the cost of children than about a desire to=
 set their lives on track.</p>
<p>Portillo, who is 22, said her immigrant parents had raised her and her t=
hree siblings frugally and done fine.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIf they did it, I certainly should be able to,=E2=80=9D she sai=
d.</p>
<p>Hispanic women, who once had by far the highest fertility of any major r=
acial or ethnic group, have had the single largest drop in fertility of any=
 group, more than a third since 2007. In Arizona, Hispanic women made up ap=
proximately 60% of the total decline in births in the state since 2007, acc=
ording to a University of Arizona analysis.
</p><p>
Miguel Brusuelas, an instructor at GateWay Community College, where Portill=
o is a student, said that 20 years ago, most of his students in their 20s w=
ere single mothers, struggling to make ends meet. Today, far fewer have chi=
ldren, he said. Many have specific career goals for their education. About =
half of GateWay=E2=80=99s students are Hispanic, and nearly half are the fi=
rst in their families to go to college.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhat I see now is students looking beyond, =E2=80=98OK, I have =
to pay this bill next week,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Brusuelas said. =E2=80=9CI se=
e them looking into the future.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Some women said they wanted to build a career as a way to avoid repeatin=
g difficult childhoods. Jakeisha Ezuma grew up on the South Side of Chicago=
, one of 10 children. Her older sisters, she said, had several children, an=
d for a while in her teens, she wanted nothing more than to become pregnant=
, too. But she did not. Now 26 and living in Denver, she wants to wait. She=
 is earning her dental hygienist degree, which comes with more money and a =
more flexible schedule than her current job as a dental assistant.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m trying to go higher,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI =
grew up around dysfunctional things. I feel like if I succeed, my children =
won=E2=80=99t have to. I=E2=80=99ll be breaking the generational cycle.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>
<b>Fewer Unintended Pregnancies</b>
</p>
<p>The largest declines in births have been in unintended pregnancies and t=
hose to single mothers, Myers found. The birthrate for unmarried women drop=
ped 18%, compared with 11% for married women.</p>
<p>A major reason women are able to be more intentional about when to have =
children is better access to birth control. Long-acting reversible contrace=
ption, such as arm implants and IUDs, have given women new options, and the=
 Affordable Care Act made many of them free.</p>
<p>The lower rate of unplanned pregnancy is a signal that the decline in bi=
rths =E2=80=94 despite the hand-wringing about what it portends for the nat=
ion=E2=80=99s workforce and social safety net =E2=80=94 could be good news =
for individual women.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COne of the big shifts has been fewer people having kids before =
they wanted to,=E2=80=9D said Amanda Jean Stevenson, a demographer at the U=
niversity of Colorado. =E2=80=9CMaybe there are fewer babies right now, but=
 people are able to live the lives they want to, and that=E2=80=99s a profo=
und thing.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p><b>Demanding Jobs, and Demanding Children</b>
</p>
<p>Researchers cannot say for sure if education is a cause of the fertility=
 decline, but there appears to be some connection. What is clear is that wo=
men are far more educated than they were in past generations, even since th=
e Great Recession in 2008.</p>
<p>Women=E2=80=99s graduation rates are now rising faster than men=E2=80=99=
s. One-third of women in their 20s had a college degree in 2019, up from on=
e-quarter in 2007.</p>
<p>Their place in the labor force has changed, too. Forty-four percent of f=
emale workers are in professional or management occupations, compared with =
38% before 2008. The number of women doing jobs that do not require as much=
 education, like office assistant, has dropped.</p>
<p>The emphasis on career has spread beyond women with bachelor=E2=80=99s d=
egrees =E2=80=94 as has a recognition of how children can derail it.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe perceived price of having children has really increased sin=
ce I first talked to women in the mid-1990s,=E2=80=9D said Kathryn Edin, a =
sociologist at Princeton University who has spent years writing about low-i=
ncome families. =E2=80=9CEven among the poorest women, there=E2=80=99s a re=
cognition that a career is part of a life course.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At the same time, there was more of a glorification of work in American =
culture, and workplaces began expecting employees to be available around th=
e clock. Yet there is little in the way of policies to help parents combine=
 work and family.</p>
<p>Parenting, too, became more stressful. American parents spend more money=
 and time on their children than any previous generation, and many feel imm=
ense pressure to be constantly teaching their children, enrolling them in e=
nrichment classes and giving them their undivided attention. This is known =
as intensive parenting, and while it used to be an upper-middle-class pheno=
menon, it is now rising fast across all social classes.
</p><p>
Schoenherr is acutely aware of how much the demands of parenting have chang=
ed. She was born on a bean and corn farm in Illinois. Her parents divorced =
when she was 2, and her grandmother babysat while her mother was at work. S=
he remembers long days of riding her bike and coming home when the streetli=
ghts came on.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBack then you could let your kids do whatever and you wouldn=E2=
=80=99t be judged,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CNow there=E2=80=99s so much =
mom shaming. You are looked down on if you are not fully focused on your ki=
d.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
A number of women said they wanted to avoid the schedules of their working-=
class parents because they were inflexible and allowed little time for play=
 or family activities.</p>
<p>Alejandra De Santiago, of Surprise, Arizona, remembers yearning for her =
mother to stop by school during lunch the way other mothers did, but she wa=
s always working. Her parents, a house cleaner and a truck driver, both imm=
igrants from Mexico, divorced when she was 7, and she was raised mostly by =
her grandmother, while her mother worked.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI want to know who I am first before having kids,=E2=80=9D she =
said.
</p><p>
De Santiago, 23, said she wanted to start a spa business, which would allow=
 her to control her schedule more than hourly work.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t want them to feel closer to their babysitter th=
an to me,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether young women will end up having the children that=
 =E2=80=94 at least so far =E2=80=94 they are putting off. In surveys, they=
 say they still want them, though the number of children they intend to hav=
e has fallen. It is possible that the drop over the past decade is a new no=
rmal for fertility in America, one that looks more like what has happened i=
n Europe and some Asian nations.</p>
<p>Kristal Wynn, 36, grew up in rural Florida. Her best friend from high sc=
hool had three children by the time she was 19, and Wynn knew she did not w=
ant that. She eventually became a nurse. Now living in Denver, she is going=
 back to school to earn her bachelor=E2=80=99s degree, a longtime dream and=
 something no one in her family has done.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was something no one ever expected me to do, I never expecte=
d myself to do,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>As for children, she said she still wants them but that =E2=80=9Cit won=
=E2=80=99t be the end of the world if it doesn=E2=80=99t happen.=E2=80=9D S=
he loves learning, traveling and living in Denver. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m at =
the point in my life where I could be fulfilled by other things.=E2=80=9D

<p>This generation of women had achieved what no other had. They were part =
of a monumental shift in the roles women could play in American society tha=
t began in the late 1970s and continues today =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9Cthe quiet =
revolution,=E2=80=9D economist Claudia Goldin calls it. In 1955, women were=
 one-third of the U.S. the labor force =E2=80=94 they were unlikely to atte=
nd college, and if they worked, they were expected to be teachers or secret=
aries. That share slowly expanded until, in January 2019, women achieved a =
milestone: They made up more of the workforce than men.</p>
<p>The pandemic erased that progress in a matter of weeks, and just as it t=
ook decades to achieve, it could take years to regain. Last spring, 5.1 mil=
lion U.S. mothers of young children stopped working for pay. Today, 1.3 mil=
lion of them are out of work. Now, 56% of American women are working for pa=
y, the lowest level since 1986.</p>
<p>When the pandemic created a child care crisis, mothers became the defaul=
t solution. Even as society starts to reopen, many feel forgotten. Child ca=
re, education and other aspects of daily life remain disrupted because youn=
g children cannot yet be vaccinated; and government paid-leave programs hav=
e expired.</p>
<p>Interviews with 15 mothers in one place, Los Angeles County, reveal the =
costs when society relies on mothers to be the backup plan. For mothers who=
 have had to stop working, it=E2=80=99s been more than the loss of a payche=
ck. It=E2=80=99s a loss of self-determination, of self-reliance, of complex=
 selves. No matter the jobs they held, the education they had or the backgr=
ounds they came from, they described a loss of identity apart from being a =
mother.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CMen who are out of work are still presumed to be workers, but w=
omen aren=E2=80=99t, because we frame work for women as a choice,=E2=80=9D =
said Sarah Damaske, a sociologist at Pennsylvania State University whose bo=
ok, =E2=80=9CThe Tolls of Uncertainty,=E2=80=9D published this month, is ab=
out how unemployed Americans=E2=80=99 experiences are shaped by gender and =
class. =E2=80=9CSo when they unexpectedly lose a job in a society in which =
their working was in question all the time, it really throws how they=E2=80=
=99re thinking about who they are into question.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Women have more options now for what to do with their lives =E2=80=94 bu=
t that also means that whether they work for pay or stay home with children=
 is often considered a personal choice. What=E2=80=99s happened to America=
=E2=80=99s working mothers in the last year is the story of what happens wh=
en any choices they once had disappeared.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not: =E2=80=98I had to make a choice.=E2=80=99 The=
 choice was made for me and a million other people,=E2=80=9D said Joy Meule=
nberg, 37, after her dog-walking business and acting auditions dwindled and=
 her daughter=E2=80=99s school closed.</p>
<p>Leah Duenas Torres, 37, who lost her sales job, had been the first in he=
r family to go to college. She earned a master=E2=80=99s degree and support=
ed her husband and family as he attended medical school. Then, instead of b=
eing the =E2=80=9Cfun mom,=E2=80=9D she became =E2=80=9Cthe enforcer,=E2=80=
=9D helping Santino, who is 7 and has autism, and Phoenix, 5, attend online=
 school.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI wasn=E2=80=99t a stay-at-home mom, and now I=E2=80=99m not a =
breadwinner,=E2=80=9D said Torres, who is expecting a baby this spring. =E2=
=80=9CI haven=E2=80=99t even said out loud any aspirations. I don=E2=80=99t=
 know what I=E2=80=99m going to do with my life anymore besides be a mom.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI appreciate Zoloft more now than ever,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>Marina Bonilla, 40, lost her job as a hotel housekeeper when the pandemi=
c began. A single mother, she immigrated to the United States from El Salva=
dor to find a better life for her daughter, Genesis, 4. Central to that was=
 earning a living: =E2=80=9CI was used to going to work and making money to=
 buy the necessities for me and my daughter,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI =
wanted to cry.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>She was grateful for having more time with Genesis, but this spring, whe=
n she found a job as a hospital housekeeper, it felt like relief: =E2=80=9C=
I thank God that he gave me the strength to go on.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
Women on the opposite end of the income spectrum also grieved their loss of=
 agency. One month before the world shut down, Jenna Lecce Streit, 48, an a=
cupuncturist, found a space to open her own practice. She had taken time of=
f work before her son, Sidney, 8, entered school, and was reveling in being=
 back.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt was time for me to be my own independent person, to really d=
ive into my career,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CIt was like, oh my gosh, I=
=E2=80=99m finally there. I=E2=80=99m 48 years old and I=E2=80=99m finally =
there.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Now, she=E2=80=99s overseeing Sidney=E2=80=99s remote school from their =
vacation home in Mazatl=C3=A1n, Mexico. Her husband regularly travels for w=
ork as a reality TV producer, and has become a COVID compliance officer for=
 film sets, so his career has =E2=80=9Cblossomed,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI literally am bloated when I=E2=80=99m not working because my =
chi isn=E2=80=99t flowing,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI know it=E2=80=99s =
a very L.A. thing to say. But it=E2=80=99s really brought to the forefront =
the paradox of being a working woman who is a wife and mother. The paradox =
is so screaming bright shining in my face right now. I love everything abou=
t motherhood, and yet it doesn=E2=80=99t feel fair that I should have to sa=
crifice my career.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI guess what I=E2=80=99m missing is that thing that=E2=80=99s m=
ine, and what that is is the little piece of my identity that=E2=80=99s my =
career.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
<b> Loss of Choice </b>
</p>
<p>Of the 1.3 million mothers living with babies, toddlers or school-age ch=
ildren who are no longer working for pay, some are on leave from their jobs=
, some are looking for work and others have given up for now, according to =
census data.</p>
<p>Since late fall, more mothers living with school-age children have retur=
ned to work, almost catching up with fathers, but mothers=E2=80=99 return t=
o work has stalled. The number of mothers living with preschool or school-a=
ged children who are actively working is down 4%, about the same as adults =
without children at home, though their reasons for being out of work are ve=
ry different.</p>
<p>A new survey by Morning Consult for The New York Times =E2=80=94 of a re=
presentative group of 1,001 mothers nationwide who were working for pay bef=
ore the pandemic began, including 448 who quit =E2=80=94 found that 60% of =
those who quit were satisfied with their decision. Another 20% had consider=
ed quitting for child care reasons. But that doesn=E2=80=99t mean it=E2=80=
=99s what they would have chosen if they had options. Eighty percent said t=
hey were the only parent who considered quitting =E2=80=94 their partner di=
d not.</p>
<p>Employment fell more sharply for those without college educations or hig=
h incomes; for those whose jobs couldn=E2=80=99t be done from home; and for=
 those who are Black or Latina. But the biggest difference between mothers =
who kept working and didn=E2=80=99t, the survey found, was simply whether t=
heir children=E2=80=99s schools were open.</p>
<p>Nationwide, just over half of districts are offering full-time, in-perso=
n learning, and an additional one-fifth are open part time. Los Angeles pub=
lic schools reopened last month, some for three hours a day, and 55% of ele=
mentary students have returned.</p>
<p>Fathers, grandparents and others have left the workforce, too. In famili=
es in which fathers did more of the pandemic child care, mothers were more =
likely to stay employed, research shows.</p>
<p>But in most cases, it has been mothers who cut back on paid work for chi=
ld care. Of fathers living with their children, 600,000 are still out of wo=
rk, though they are much less likely to have left for child care reasons, t=
he census analysis shows.</p>
<p>Jennifer Park Zerkel, 42, who had started a tutoring business, said: =E2=
=80=9CIf I didn=E2=80=99t have kids, I=E2=80=99d be down there, I=E2=80=99d=
 be full on trying to get my business back up. But who=E2=80=99s going to t=
ake care of my kids?=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Her husband often works long hours, but even when he doesn=E2=80=99t, he=
 keeps his own schedule. =E2=80=9CI am the primary parent,=E2=80=9D she sai=
d.
</p><p>
There are many reasons that mothers are the default caregivers, beginning w=
ith centuries of tradition. They are also generally paid less than their hu=
sbands. But this is a vicious cycle: The gender pay gap starts when women b=
ecome mothers =E2=80=94 because they spend more time than men on child care=
, or employers assume they will. Then, when one parent has to step back fro=
m paid work for caregiving, mothers do because they earn less, reinforcing =
the pattern.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy rewards undivided loyalty. Salaried employees who work =
long hours are paid disproportionately more, and many hourly workers are ex=
pected to be available on a moment=E2=80=99s notice. Part-time work, at lea=
st the kind offering decent pay and employee benefits, isn=E2=80=99t widely=
 available, and the United States is the only industrialized nation that do=
esn=E2=80=99t mandate paid family leave. (For the first time, Congress pass=
ed 12 weeks of paid caregiving leave during the pandemic, but it expired at=
 the end of 2020.)</p>
<p>
=E2=80=9CWe think we=E2=80=99ve progressed so much, and then this pandemic =
happens and we all just revert back to these traditional behaviors,=E2=80=
=9D said Misty L. Heggeness, a principal economist at the Census Bureau. =
=E2=80=9CAnd this is a good moment to reflect, why do we do that?=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
<p>Delia Hauser, 40, a costumer and artist, had a thriving freelance career=
 she had built from the garage she converted to an office. Now, the office =
is used by her husband, a creative director. She is in the house, caring fo=
r sons George, 7, who has a rare disability and needs help for his Zoom mee=
tings, and Fred, 4, when he is not in preschool.</p>
<p>There was never a thought that her husband would be the one to stop work=
ing. =E2=80=9CHe makes way more money than I probably ever could,=E2=80=9D =
she said. =E2=80=9CBut also, I was already very much in charge of George=E2=
=80=99s world. The expectation is just always on us to give up things. No o=
ne even has to say it. It just is.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p><b> Loss of Self-Reliance </b>
</p>
<p>Mothers across the income and career spectrum described devotion to the =
jobs they had.</p>
<p>Ana Recinos, 32, had worked several jobs at once since she was 18. When =
her daughter Josephine=E2=80=99s school closed, she quit her full-time jobs=
, as a waitress and at Target, while her wife continued working in retail. =
Now she spends her days caring for Josephine, 10, and researching food bank=
s.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI feel like I let my family down,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>Damaske, from Penn State, said that in her research, low-wage women had =
stronger attachments to work because of the effort it took to arrange adequ=
ate child care. =E2=80=9CResearchers and the public alike can look at low-w=
age workers and not see the effort that goes into keeping and doing those j=
obs, especially for women with kids,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>For many mothers, losing work felt like losing their independence.</p>
<p>Guadalupe Villegas had been homeless but had regained custody of her chi=
ldren, and was working two jobs as a prep cook. Those jobs disappeared with=
 the shutdowns, and her biggest fear is losing her children again. Now she =
is caring for her children and her mother, who was found to have cancer las=
t year.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI am an overloaded ship right now,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p>Da=E2=80=99Chante Bowers, 28, had also been on a path out of poverty. Th=
e single mother of Victory, 4, Bowers was attending community college.</p>
<p>Last fall, she was accepted to the University of California, Irvine, her=
 =E2=80=9Cdream school.=E2=80=9D But three weeks into the semester, she had=
 to drop out =E2=80=94 Victory was too young to attend preschool online.</p=
>
<p>They live on county aid, =E2=80=9Cand that is not enough to feed a Fifi =
bird.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Victory=E2=80=99s father is not around. Bowers re-enrolled this spring, =
and her father helps watch Victory when she has class.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBeing on the path I wanted to be on, I=E2=80=99ve worked so har=
d to get there, and for it to come to such a halt, it=E2=80=99s mind-boggli=
ng,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI think that=E2=80=99s the best way I could=
 describe it without getting too emotional.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p><b> Loss of a Worker=E2=80=99s Purpose </b>
</p>
<p>Working mothers=E2=80=99 dual identities have always affected their care=
ers. In a study in which researchers sent out fake r=C3=A9sum=C3=A9s =E2=80=
=94 identical except for a line about being a member of the PTA =E2=80=94 p=
arents were less likely to get interviews. Mothers receive less pay and few=
er promotions. Workers who ask for flexibility for family reasons are often=
 penalized; those who hide the reason are not.</p>
<p>The pandemic made it impossible for parents to hide that part of their i=
dentity at work.
</p><p>
Marisa Smith, 40, who worked as a business manager, was the only person in =
her office who was furloughed =E2=80=94 and the only parent. Shortly after =
she returned, someone at her 6-year-old son Kai=E2=80=99s day care contract=
ed the coronavirus, so she had to stay home with him to quarantine. After t=
hat, she was laid off.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI have to kind of wonder if it was because I had a son,=E2=80=
=9D said Smith, who is divorced from Kai=E2=80=99s father.</p>
<p>She applied for jobs for months before she found a new business manager =
role. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s hard to feel good about yourself when you=E2=80=
=99re not feeling like a productive person in society,=E2=80=9D she said.</=
p>
<p>
Many American women have carefully planned their working lives to accommoda=
te children. They choose jobs with more flexibility or fewer hours, even if=
 they earn less or are overqualified, or start businesses so they can contr=
ol their schedules. The new survey found that self-employed women were much=
 more likely to quit in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Lola Keyes Wood had co-founded a Hollywood travel and event company, now=
 closed with no plans to reopen. Her husband, founder of a consulting compa=
ny, has continued to work, often traveling. To get help with their children=
, Hendrix, 6, and Lenox, 2, Wood decamped to her parents=E2=80=99 house in =
Virginia.</p>
<p>Her children are too young to do remote school without help. The 30 hour=
s a week she worked pre-pandemic is now 10 if she=E2=80=99s lucky. She work=
s on business ideas 2 1/2 hours a day while Lenox goes to a play group.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CEven with the help of a babysitter, laundry piles up, the kitch=
en=E2=80=99s dirty,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CWhen do you open your bills=
? Did you respond to the stuff that came in the mail? No, I did not, becaus=
e I only have 2 1/2 hours a day.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p><b> Loss of a Mother=E2=80=99s Confidence </b>
</p>
<p>Even in normal times, American mothers, more than those in other rich co=
untries, describe feeling guilty and stressed. The pandemic seemed to sharp=
en that self-doubt.
</p><p>
Meulenberg, the dog walker, and her husband, a set dresser, had taken turns=
 being the primary earner. When the pandemic began, he was earning more, so=
 she took over the care of their 5-year-old daughter, Madeleine. She=E2=80=
=99s grateful her husband has work, but feels her life is on hold: =E2=80=
=9CI=E2=80=99m not a housewife person.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pandemic sent many working mothers into crisis mode, and they did wh=
at they have always done =E2=80=94 cared for their children when they neede=
d it.</p>
<p>
Now, with vaccines available for those 12 and older and with more schools o=
pen, the mothers in Los Angeles said they still couldn=E2=80=99t see the fu=
ture =E2=80=94 school and camp schedules aren=E2=80=99t back to normal, and=
 some didn=E2=80=99t feel school was safe yet =E2=80=94 but they could begi=
n to contemplate it.</p>
<p>In the national survey, 70% of mothers who had quit said they planned to=
 return to paid work. Fifteen percent didn=E2=80=99t know, and the same sha=
re didn=E2=80=99t plan to return. But American workplaces frown on gaps in =
r=C3=A9sum=C3=A9s, especially for women doing caregiving.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis isn=E2=80=99t just career women climbing the ladder and ge=
tting pushed down two rungs,=E2=80=9D said Goldin, the economist. =E2=80=9C=
I am very, very concerned about women working in sectors that have been imp=
loded and probably won=E2=80=99t come back anywhere near where they were.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>There are things that could help, starting with fully opening schools an=
d child care centers. Incentives like tax credits could encourage companies=
 to rehire mothers. Job search and retraining programs could help workers f=
ind jobs outside the service industry. Longer term, researchers say, the pr=
edicament could be blunted with policies like paid sick and family leave, a=
ffordable child care and financial support for unpaid caregivers.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis offers the opportunity to really reimagine how things can =
operate differently,=E2=80=9D said Michelle Rhone-Collins, chief executive =
of Lift, a nonprofit that helps mothers and children living in poverty.</p>
<p>For their part, the women interviewed in Los Angeles County said they we=
re determined to make their way back to paid work. Some were grateful for t=
he detour.</p>
<p>Wood, who closed her events business, said the pandemic gave her the fir=
st chance since graduate school to pause and evaluate her career. She is st=
arting a new business, inspired by her children =E2=80=94 a line of pajamas=
 with Black Santa that she wants to expand.</p>
<p>April Williams, 40, who was laid off after achieving her dream promotion=
, is also starting a business. Her son Zell, 9, has made her a =E2=80=9Cbas=
ketball mom,=E2=80=9D and she=E2=80=99s planning to open a high-end gym in =
their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Hauser, the costume designer, is considering becoming a disability advoc=
ate, using the experiences she has had helping her son. Recinos, so accusto=
med to working two full-time jobs, has started an online training course to=
 become a medical assistant.</p>
<p>Zerkel, who started the tutoring business, wants to open a preschool as =
well. Villegas is trying to get certification as a home health aide, the jo=
b she has been doing for her mother.</p>
<p>If Bowers finishes college, she plans to use her education to become a s=
ocial worker: =E2=80=9CI want to be able to help people, give people a pers=
on to relate to, to know that they can make it through anything.=E2=80=9D

<p>GRAND ISLAND, Neb. =E2=80=94 To grasp the impact of the latest great wav=
e of immigration to the United States, consider the city of Grand Island, N=
ebraska: More than 60% of public school students are nonwhite, and their fa=
milies collectively speak 55 languages. During drop-off at Starr Elementary=
 on a recent morning, parents bid their children goodbye in Spanish, Somali=
 and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CYou wouldn=E2=80=99t expect to see so many languages spoken in =
a school district of 10,000,=E2=80=9D said Tawana Grover, the school superi=
ntendent who arrived from Dallas four years ago. =E2=80=9CWhen you hear Neb=
raska, you don=E2=80=99t think diversity. We=E2=80=99ve got the world right=
 here in rural America.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The students are the children of foreign-born workers who flocked to thi=
s town of 51,000 in the 1990s and 2000s to toil in the area=E2=80=99s meatp=
acking plants, where speaking English was less necessary than a willingness=
 to do the grueling work.</p>
<p>They came to Nebraska from every corner of the globe: Mexicans, Guatemal=
ans and Hondurans who floated across the Rio Grande on inner tubes, in sear=
ch of a better life; refugees who fled famine in South Sudan and war in Ira=
q to find safe haven; Salvadorans and Cambodians who spent years scratching=
 for work in California and heard that jobs in Nebraska were plentiful and =
the cost of living low.</p>
<p>The story of how millions of immigrants since the 1970s have put down la=
sting roots across the country is by now well-known. What is less understoo=
d about President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s four-year-long push to shut the bo=
rders and put =E2=80=9CAmerica First=E2=80=9D is that his quest may prove u=
ltimately a futile one. Even with one of the most severe declines in immigr=
ation since the 1920s, the country is on an irreversible course to becoming=
 ever more diverse, and more dependent on immigrants and their children.</p=
>
<p>The president since the moment he took office issued a torrent of orders=
 that reduced refugee admissions, narrowed who is eligible for asylum, made=
 it more difficult to qualify for permanent residency or citizenship, tight=
ened scrutiny of applicants for high-skilled worker visas, and sought to li=
mit the length of stay for international students. His policies slashed the=
 number of migrants arrested and then released into the country from nearly=
 500,000 in fiscal 2019 to 15,000 in fiscal 2020.</p>
<p>The measures worked: =E2=80=9CWe are going to end the decade with lower =
immigration than in any decade since the =E2=80=9970s,=E2=80=9D said Willia=
m Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed newly av=
ailable census data.</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to reverse many of the measures. H=
e has vowed to reinstate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as D=
ACA, an Obama-era program that allowed young adults mainly brought to the U=
nited States illegally as children to remain, and to resume accepting refug=
ees and asylum-seekers in larger numbers.</p>
<p>He has also said he would introduce legislation to offer a path to citiz=
enship for people in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Yet immigration remains a flashpoint for Americans, millions of whom hav=
e supported Trump=E2=80=99s clampdown, and pushing any substantial immigrat=
ion reform through Congress will prove difficult as long as Republicans rem=
ain in control of the Senate.</p>
<p>And in any case, Trump=E2=80=99s immigration legacy cannot be unraveled =
overnight. While some of the executive orders and memorandums that helped c=
lose off the border can be rolled back swiftly, hundreds of technical but s=
ignificant changes made to the immigration system will take much longer to =
undo.</p>
<p>But as Grand Island shows, nothing that Trump has done was able to halt =
the inexorable shifts unleashed by the biggest wave of immigration since th=
e 1890s, when Southern and Eastern Europeans arrived in huge numbers throug=
h Ellis Island.</p>
<p>Even if immigration were to come to a standstill, their offspring would =
continue to reshape the country.</p>
<p>In 1992, only 50 Hispanics were enrolled in Grand Island=E2=80=99s schoo=
ls. By 2001, there were 1,600 out of about 7,600 students. Now, Latinos acc=
ount for more than half of the 10,000 students in the district, and there i=
s no forecast that does not show that proportion continuing to accelerate.<=
/p>
<p>A surge in arrivals into the U.S. began in the 1970s, gathered strength =
in the 1980s and crested in the early 2000s. Millions of Latin Americans ha=
ve come. There also has been spectacular growth in the number of Asians, wh=
o outnumbered foreign-born Hispanics in 2010-19. The new immigrants are mor=
e likely than native-born Americans to have a college degree and are integr=
ated into every level of the economy. This is even more true of their child=
ren.
</p><p>
In San Francisco, Vida Ahyong, 37, a U.S.-born daughter of Filipino immigra=
nts, runs the COVID-19 diagnostic lab at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, overse=
eing a staff that includes younger Latino, African and Asian researchers wh=
o are also children of immigrants. One of them is Gloria Casta=C3=B1eda, 24=
, a Yale graduate, born in California to a janitor and a truck driver, both=
 Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>The family of Aslan Kat, 17, was granted asylum in the United States aft=
er escaping the civil war in Syria five years ago. He is the captain of the=
 varsity soccer team at Wayne Hills High School in Wayne, New Jersey, and h=
opes to play in college, where he plans to study engineering. Among his tea=
mmates are immigrants from Armenia, Cuba and Egypt.</p>
<p>
In 1920, the foreign-born accounted for 13.2% of the population. A backlash=
 against Japanese, Southern Europeans and Jews, among others, resulted in n=
ational origin quotas adopted in 1924 that put an end to a large influx tha=
t had started in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>It would take until the 1970s for immigration to climb steadily again, a=
fter the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 eliminated quotas and crea=
ted a system based on family relationships and work categories.</p>
<p>The foreign-born population grew by 5.6 million in the =E2=80=9980s, 8.8=
 million in the =E2=80=9990s and 11.3 million in the 2000s.</p>
<p>By the time Trump took office, this contemporary wave of immigration had=
 lifted the foreign-born population to 44.5 million, representing 13.7% of =
the population, the biggest share since 1910. Among them were about 11 mill=
ion immigrants in the country illegally.
</p><p>
During his first week in office, the president introduced a travel ban to h=
alt the entry of people from many Muslim countries and paused refugee reset=
tlement, citing terrorist threats.</p>
<p>As Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty showed up at t=
he border by the busload, his administration introduced policies to deter t=
hem, including the separation of migrant children from their parents.</p>
<p>He was able to do it by bypassing a Congress that has long been deadlock=
ed on immigration reform, issuing a series of executive orders and proclama=
tions that rapidly shut the door on immigration despite a flurry of legal c=
hallenges.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CTrump has demonstrably proven that you don=E2=80=99t need a gra=
nd deal to tackle immigration and border security,=E2=80=9D said James Cara=
fano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.</p>
<p>
Average net migration shrank by 45% from 2017 to 2019 from an average of 95=
3,000 during the previous seven years, as fewer immigrants arrived and more=
 left, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis of census dat=
a.</p>
<p>There will be an even more precipitous decline recorded by the close of =
2020 following visa restrictions imposed by the president amid the coronavi=
rus pandemic.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis year is truly unprecedented in how dramatic and fast this =
decline in immigration has been,=E2=80=9D said David Bier, an immigration a=
nalyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. =E2=80=9COutside of wars and the =
Great Depression, we have never seen a level of immigration like we are see=
ing right now.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Trump put much of the focus on disparaging refugees and immigrants as dr=
ains on public coffers and championing a wall on the southwestern border.</=
p>
<p>Yet all the attention on the border ignored the much more significant gr=
owth in immigration that was happening elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>The number of immigrants of Asian origin grew by 2.8 million in the nine=
 years ending 2019, more than from any other region. The biggest gains were=
 among Indians and Chinese; the number of Mexicans dropped by 779,000.
</p><p>
Many of the recent immigrants have settled in parts of the country where th=
ere is a low concentration of foreign-born people, including in states that=
 voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>Among them are Shikha Jaiswal, a nephrologist, and her husband, Nihit Gu=
pta, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who came to the United States fro=
m India to complete their residencies and are building their careers in a m=
edically underserved area of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Small-town America has come to rely on a pipeline of foreign doctors.</p=
>
<p>=E2=80=9CPeople have been very kind and grateful at the same time, makin=
g it a very rewarding experience,=E2=80=9D Jaiswal said.</p>
<p>
The children of immigrants who are already here will continue to make the U=
nited States more diverse: The 2020 census is expected to show that more th=
an half of people under 18 are people of color.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThe mainstream now increasingly includes people who are nonwhit=
e, particularly from immigrant backgrounds,=E2=80=9D said Richard Alba, a s=
ociology professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center.</p>
<p>The movement of the baby boom generation out of the labor force amid a p=
lummeting birthrate is accelerating the trend and intensifying the need for=
 new immigrant labor to pay the Social Security and Medicare bills for reti=
ring Americans.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not that native-born kids can=E2=80=99t take the b=
oomers=E2=80=99 jobs; it=E2=80=99s that there are not enough of these kids =
to take them,=E2=80=9D said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University o=
f Southern California who researches the subject.</p>
<p>That diversity is already being reflected in the higher rungs of the wor=
kforce.</p>
<p>For much of the second half of the 20th century, white workers held a vi=
rtual monopoly on the best-paying positions. But by 2015, among top-earning=
 workers under 50, about a third were nonwhite, mainly Latinos or Asians of=
 immigrant origin, according to research by Alba, who predicts that their s=
hare will only grow.</p>
<p>A study released last month found that nearly 30% of all students enroll=
ed in colleges and universities in 2018 hailed from immigrant families, up =
from 20% in 2000.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWhen you start having cohorts of college graduates that are so =
diverse, it=E2=80=99s going to change the workforce, which means more peopl=
e from diverse backgrounds moving into positions of authority and high remu=
neration,=E2=80=9D Alba said. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s no going back.=E2=80=

<p>PERRIS, Calif. =E2=80=94 For one day at least, as a 10-car parade of veh=
icles with honking horns, pompoms and signs reading =E2=80=9CGet Counted=E2=
=80=9D crawled through the predominantly Latino agricultural town of Perris=
, California, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles, on Friday, it was hard to=
 forget that the 2020 census was going on and that it mattered.</p>
<p>Daniel Cordero, 63, a Mexican immigrant who shares a home with 15 people=
, including his wife, children and grandchildren, was just the kind of pers=
on that the event, billed as =E2=80=9CGet Out the Count,=E2=80=9D was inten=
ded to reach.</p>
<p>But as he stepped out of his kitchenware store on D Street in downtown P=
erris on Friday to observe the parade, he wasn=E2=80=99t quite sold. =E2=80=
=9CWe=E2=80=99re working so hard, we don=E2=80=99t have time to be filling =
out questionnaires,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI haven=E2=80=99t filled it out,=E2=80=9D he added. =E2=80=9CI =
have never filled it out.=E2=80=9D He took a flyer from one of the voluntee=
rs, examining it like one of his customers contemplating his wares, and sai=
d that he might consider it. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99d be the first time,=E2=80=
=9D he said without much enthusiasm before returning to work in his store s=
tocked with pots, pans, brooms and other household items.</p>
<p>It has always been a challenge to get an accurate count of people in pla=
ces like this dusty working-class town of 80,000 people, where about three-=
quarters of the population is Hispanic, many of them immigrants. Throw in a=
 pandemic and a cascade of messages from President Donald Trump making many=
 Latinos wary of the census, and the challenge grows exponentially.</p>
<p>But when the Census Bureau on Monday said it would lop off four weeks fr=
om the 10 it had allocated for a door-to-door count of the hardest-to-reach=
 communities, the move added a new sense of urgency to efforts to reach Per=
ris=E2=80=99 farmworkers and immigrants living in the country without legal=
 permission, as well as other communities with different challenges around =
the country. The situation is likely to be even worse in communities and st=
ates where there is less government involvement in the census and fewer org=
anizations on the ground to press for participation.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe have to keep dodging bullets to reach our community, and now=
 we have limited time,=E2=80=9D said Luz Gallegos, the director of TODEC Le=
gal Center, an immigrant services provider that operates in Riverside and S=
an Bernardino counties. =E2=80=9CWe are going to continue to push until the=
 deadline.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The Census Bureau announced on Monday that it will halt counting on Sept=
. 30, four weeks earlier than planned, cutting short door-knocking, which b=
egins nationwide on Aug. 11, and the time people have to submit responses o=
nline, over the phone and by mail.</p>
<p>In March, the Census Bureau sent out invitations by mail to people acros=
s the country asking them to respond to the 2020 census. Next week, after a=
 delay in outreach because of the coronavirus, census workers will start kn=
ocking on doors of homes whose residents have not yet participated.</p>
<p>The numbers are enormously important, especially in a poor community in =
need of all available federal resources. The count is used to reapportion a=
ll 435 House seats and thousands of state and local districts as well as to=
 divvy up trillions of dollars in federal grants and aid.</p>
<p>Census officials say they can still do an accurate count with the new de=
adline. =E2=80=9CWe will be hiring more people to knock on those doors so w=
e can get to all of the households that haven=E2=80=99t responded yet,=E2=
=80=9D a Census Bureau spokeswoman said. =E2=80=9COur recruiting pool, whic=
h is very large, puts us in a good position to do this.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>But experts are skeptical.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe will have a flawed census that will be fatal to certain grou=
ps,=E2=80=9D said Paul Ong, a researcher at UCLA=E2=80=99s Luskin School of=
 Public Affairs who studies census participation and has served as an advis=
er to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Despite an unprecedented $187 million investment in outreach by the stat=
e and nonprofits in California, residents of Latino communities have been r=
esponding at lower rates than in 2010. Nationally, the trend is the same.</=
p>
<p>In some census tracts in far-flung areas of Riverside County, the respon=
se rate is hovering between 40% and 50%, about 10 percentage points behind =
the response rate a decade ago.</p>
<p>Even before the coronavirus hit, the census faced extraordinary challeng=
es.</p>
<p>The Constitution requires a count of all residents, regardless of nation=
ality or immigration status. California is home to almost 11 million immigr=
ants, including about 2 million who are living in the country without legal=
 permission.</p>
<p>But President Donald Trump pushed for 19 months, starting in 2018, to in=
clude a citizenship question on the decennial census, despite widespread cr=
iticism that it would dramatically depress responses, particularly from Lat=
ino immigrants. After the Supreme Court opposed the plan last year, Trump b=
acked down.</p>
<p>Then last month he directed the government not to count immigrants livin=
g in the country without legal permission for the purposes of reapportionin=
g congressional seats. His policy memorandum would have the Census Bureau r=
emove the immigrants from each state=E2=80=99s count using data estimates. =
While the move is being challenged in court, it has sown confusion anew in =
immigrant communities.</p>
<p>For many immigrants, documented and living in the country without legal =
permission, his repeated insistence on not counting people living in the co=
untry without legal permission has sent what seemed like a clear message: Y=
our participation is not wanted.</p>
<p>Liz Rivera and her husband Daniel, Mexicans living in the country withou=
t legal permission who have lived in Riverside County for 18 years, were to=
o nervous to fill out the 2010 census, they said. But this year, after atte=
nding workshops at TODEC, they were persuaded to fill out the form.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe understood that it was safe and that it was important to par=
ticipate if we want funding to improve our schools, parks and roads,=E2=80=
=9D said Liz Rivera, who said that she shared the information with friends =
and family.</p>
<p>But the couple delayed completing the online form after they, their two =
children and Liz Rivera=E2=80=99s father, who is living with them, fell ill=
 with COVID-19. While at home, they heard about Trump=E2=80=99s new preside=
ntial order to exclude immigrants living in the country without legal permi=
ssion from the count.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe were so confused. We thought we weren=E2=80=99t supposed to =
participate anymore,=E2=80=9D she recalled.</p>
<p>She decided to call TODEC to inquire, just to be sure, and a staff membe=
r assured her that the Rivera household still had every right to take part.=
 The couple plan to fill out the form next week.
</p><p>
Maria and Ramon Garcia, who have lived in the United States for two decades=
, said they had intended to complete the census until Trump=E2=80=99s recen=
t announcement. Now they fear that participating could land them in the cro=
sshairs of immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe were told that we should be counted,=E2=80=9D said Maria Gar=
cia, 50. =E2=80=9CBut then, just recently, we heard that the president does=
n=E2=80=99t want us to be counted, and we=E2=80=99re worried that we could =
be deported if we participate.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The Garcias called TODEC=E2=80=99s hotline on Friday to seek the legal c=
enter=E2=80=99s advice but could not be convinced that participating was sa=
fe.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe came here from Mexico many years ago. We pay taxes, we work =
hard, and we don=E2=80=99t want to put that in jeopardy,=E2=80=9D said Ramo=
n Garcia, 57, who has a gardening business with his wife. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=
=80=99t think we should participate in the census.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Ad=C3=A1n Ch=C3=A1vez, deputy director of the national census program at=
 the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educati=
onal Fund, said that reaction was widespread.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe have had to contend with challenge after challenge, attack a=
fter attack that threatens our census work,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
<p>The group has responded by intensifying its =E2=80=9C=C2=A1Hagase Contar=
!=E2=80=9D (=E2=80=9CBe Counted=E2=80=9D) campaign, working with Spanish-la=
nguage television to promote participation and calls to a hotline that answ=
ers questions and helps people complete the census in Spanish.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9COur lift was already much heavier in the middle of a pandemic,=
=E2=80=9D Ch=C3=A1vez said. =E2=80=9CNow we=E2=80=99re having to tell peopl=
e that everyone gets counted. It=E2=80=99s your right. Don=E2=80=99t worry.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
According to an analysis of census data to be released next week by Ong=E2=
=80=99s team, the estimated median response rate for Hispanics nationwide w=
as 50% by August, down by nearly 13 percentage points from 2010. Among non-=
Hispanic whites, the estimated response rate was 69%, compared with 71% a d=
ecade ago.</p>
<p>States with large populations of people living in the country without le=
gal permission =E2=80=94 California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey a=
nd Illinois =E2=80=94 stand to lose the most from an undercount.</p>
<p>TODEC volunteers began last year to go door-to-door in hard-to-count nei=
ghborhoods, in the rural reaches of Riverside County, to educate immigrants=
 about the census. They erected booths at health fairs and hosted informati=
on sessions to educate people about the census.
</p><p>
But like other groups working in the field, it was forced to shift strategy=
 =E2=80=94 to phone banking, social media and Zoom info sessions in March, =
when the coronavirus began coursing through California.</p>
<p>On a Zoom call last Thursday titled =E2=80=9CThe Census and My Community=
,=E2=80=9C which was also streamed on Facebook, TODEC staff and a Census Bu=
reau representative spent a full hour trying to motivate Latinos to partici=
pate.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIf we respond, our community will get money. But if we aren=E2=
=80=99t counted, it=E2=80=99s as if we don=E2=80=99t exist,=E2=80=9D said L=
upe Camacho, the bureau=E2=80=99s representative.</p>
<p>She appealed to their commonality as immigrants. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m fr=
om Mexico,=E2=80=9D said Camacho, who spoke in Spanish throughout the sessi=
on. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a naturalized citizen. But citizenship has nothing=
 to do with this.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>During the session, she described the census as =E2=80=9Cpure statistics=
,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ccompletely confidential=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cposing no=
 danger,=E2=80=9D all but pleading for participation.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t pass on any information about anyone =E2=80=94=
 not to the DMV, not to ICE, not to any city, state or federal authority,=
=E2=80=9D she said, referring to the department of motor vehicles and Immig=
ration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>
In Perris, there were bright moments as well as cautionary ones.</p>
<p>Maria Estela Perez Gomez, 55, emerged from her beige house at the sight =
of the caravan. =E2=80=9CWe filled out our census form,=E2=80=9D she said e=
xcitedly, doing a little dance as a Mexican band that was part of the parad=
e and procession played.</p>
<p>The hurdles have also motivated some people.</p>
<p>Montserrat Gomez, a 19-year-old college student, said the decision to cu=
rtail the count was one reason she joined the group of young adults, mostly=
 children of immigrants, who marched through downtown Perris on Friday wavi=
ng signs and distributing flyers.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe need to convince them that they need to be counted so that t=
he community receives the political representation and financial resources =
that it deserves,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CAnd now we have less time to =
do it.=E2=80=9D

<p>Robert Gnaizda, a lawyer whose deft powers of persuasion in defending th=
e civil and economic rights of the poor and minority groups often rendered =
messy and costly lawsuits against their adversaries a needless last resort,=
 died on July 11 in San Francisco. He was 83.</p>
<p>The cause was listed as a heart attack. His son Matthew said he had been=
 in declining health for some time.</p>
<p>Gnaizda (pronounced guh-NAYJH-duh) risked his life gathering evidence in=
 the South in the 1960s to help fight the intimidation that kept Black citi=
zens from registering and voting. He was also an advocate for farmworkers a=
nd the rural poor, fought discrimination in hiring by police and fire depar=
tments, and successfully challenged banks that victimized Black and Hispani=
c borrowers.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CBob Gnaizda was, in my opinion, the most imaginative, creative =
and consequential public interest lawyer of his generation in the United St=
ates,=E2=80=9D said J. Anthony Kline, presiding justice of the California C=
ourt of Appeal in San Francisco, who, with Gnaizda and two other lawyers, f=
ormed a pioneering public interest law firm in California in 1971.</p>
<p>The marginalized plaintiffs he represented =E2=80=9Cwere devoted to him =
because he incorporated them in strategic decision making and ensured they =
received credit for victories,=E2=80=9D Kline said by email, and =E2=80=9Ct=
he respect he had from many of his adversaries enabled him to negotiate set=
tlements that became established progressive norms without the need to enga=
ge in expensive and time-consuming litigation.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Robert Leslie Gnaizda was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 6, 1936, to Sandra (A=
ckerman) Gnaizda, the daughter of Russian and Polish immigrants, who ran a =
commercial real estate business, and Samuel Gnaizda, a Jewish immigrant fro=
m Russia, who became a pharmacist. He was raised in the Brownsville section=
, then a gritty Jewish enclave, where he defended vulnerable friends agains=
t neighborhood bullies and biked to Ebbets Field to cheer on Jackie Robinso=
n.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CDodger fans had a reputation for being rude and rowdy,=E2=80=9D=
 his son said. =E2=80=9CBut 10-year-old Bob observed that the Black fans at=
 the stadium were extremely polite, well behaved and well dressed =E2=80=94=
 unlike the other fans. And this made him begin to question the common ster=
eotypes.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>As a teenager he also worked in a job training program for Black youngst=
ers, his son said. He added: =E2=80=9CThese experiences =E2=80=94 plus the =
discrimination he felt as a Jew =E2=80=94 led him to see that there was inj=
ustice in the world. And he wanted to do something about it.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>After graduating from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, Gnaizda atten=
ded Columbia University, where he was so struck that his classmates were al=
most all white and male that he was prompted to write an article for the Co=
lumbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI asked two questions: One related to women, the other related =
to Black students,=E2=80=9D he said in an interview with Columbia College T=
oday, an alumni publication, in 2018. =E2=80=9CI wondered why a school at t=
he edge of Harlem had only one Black student per undergraduate class. And b=
ecause my own mother was outstanding at everything she did, I wondered why =
we didn=E2=80=99t have any women. But the paper wouldn=E2=80=99t print it; =
they thought it was too inflammatory.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Gnaizda graduated from Columbia in 1957. He considered studying medicine=
 but decided to apply to law school at Harvard and Yale and become a lawyer=
 if he was admitted by either. He was accepted by both and chose Yale. He e=
arned his law degree in 1960.</p>
<p>Asked in the 2018 interview what drove him to abandon corporate law when=
 he was 28 to pursue a social justice agenda, he replied facetiously: =E2=
=80=9CI think boredom. I was a tax attorney, and the work didn=E2=80=99t in=
terest me much. I decided to go to Mississippi in early 1965, and there I r=
ealized that I had some natural talents.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>By cultivating local white civic leaders in conversations that dealt as =
much with baseball as with voting, he was able to gather enough evidence du=
ring a public hearing on the disenfranchisement of Black people in Clay Cou=
nty, Mississippi, to help propel passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>Gnaizda lived in San Francisco. In addition to his son Matthew, he is su=
rvived by his wife, Claudia Viek; another son, Joshua; and a granddaughter.=
 His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to Ellen Eatough. =
(Both his sons are from that marriage.)</p>
<p>He founded California Rural Legal Assistance in 1966 and, five years lat=
er, Public Advocates, a firm that defended underdogs, with Kline, Sid Wolin=
sky and Peter Sitkin. He also helped found the Greenlining Institute in 199=
3 to discourage financial institutions from discriminating against Black an=
d Hispanic homebuyers. He was later general counsel for the National Asian =
American Coalition and the National Diversity Coalition.</p>
<p>Through those and other organizations, Gnaizda accused the Census Bureau=
 of undercounting Hispanic residents in 1970 and pressured the San Francisc=
o Police Department to hire more minority recruits in the 1970s.</p>
<p>He fought redlining by banks that refused to lend to residents of minori=
ty neighborhoods. He fostered investment in those communities by leveraging=
 the lenders=E2=80=99 lack of public-spiritedness against them when they ne=
eded government permission to merge with other banks.</p>
<p>From 1975 to 1976, he was deputy secretary of health and welfare for Gov=
. Jerry Brown of California. But years later, when Brown was governor for a=
 second time. Gnaizda didn=E2=80=99t hesitate to sue him for diverting the =
proceeds the state received from lawsuits relating to national mortgage fra=
ud settlements. The state was eventually ordered to repay the money.</p>
<p>Gnaizda was interviewed for the Oscar-winning documentary =E2=80=9CInsid=
e Job=E2=80=9D (2010) about his efforts in the mid-2000s to warn the Federa=
l Reserve of the impending subprime mortgage crisis.
</p><p>
His penchant for representing victims of bullying led him into some unusual=
 cases. There were, for example, the two 7-year-olds in California who sued=
 Pacific Bell Telephone in 1985 for failing to inform them that they would =
incur a 50-cent charge every time they dialed a Santa Claus line. (He also =
founded a Giraffe Appreciation Society whose directors, all children, paid =
tribute to the ruminants =E2=80=9Cwho don=E2=80=99t do any harm and who sti=
ck their necks out.=E2=80=9D)</p>
<p>What distinguished Gnaizda as a zealous public interest lawyer, his son =
Matthew said, was that he =E2=80=9Cnever saw the other side as evil; he saw=
 them as people who he disagreed with on certain issues, but could be convi=
nced to change their behavior.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Gnaizda agreed that many of his lawsuits were successful because he didn=
=E2=80=99t force his opponents into a corner. =E2=80=9CThey were just on a =
different side, and when they lost, they would usually keep their word,=E2=
=80=9D he said in the Columbia College Today interview.</p>
<p>Rebecca Kee, who worked with Gnaizda at the National Diversity Coalition=
, put it this way: =E2=80=9CBob will sue you, and somehow you=E2=80=99ll st=
ill like him.=E2=80=9D

<p>WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 President Donald Trump directed the federal governm=
ent on Tuesday not to count immigrants who are living in the country illega=
lly when allocating the nation=E2=80=99s House districts, a move that criti=
cs called a transparent political ploy to help Republicans in violation of =
the Constitution.</p>
<p>The president=E2=80=99s directive would exclude millions of people when =
determining how many House seats each state should have based on the once-a=
-decade census, reversing the long-standing policy of counting everyone reg=
ardless of citizenship or legal status. The effect would likely shift sever=
al seats from Democratic states to Republican states.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThere used to be a time when you could proudly declare, =E2=80=
=98I am a citizen of the United States,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Trump said in a w=
ritten statement after signing a memorandum to the Commerce Department, whi=
ch oversees the Census Bureau. =E2=80=9CBut now, the radical left is trying=
 to erase the existence of this concept and conceal the number of illegal a=
liens in our country. This is all part of a broader left-wing effort to ero=
de the rights of Americans citizens, and I will not stand for it.=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
<p>The action directly conflicts with the traditional consensus interpretat=
ion of the Constitution and will almost surely be challenged in court, pote=
ntially delaying its effect if not blocking its enactment altogether. But i=
t fit into Trump=E2=80=99s efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigrati=
on at a time when he is anxiously trying to galvanize his political base he=
ading into a fall election season trailing his Democratic opponent.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI think the Donald Trump view is: =E2=80=98I can look like I=E2=
=80=99m trying to do something by stoking anti-immigrant fervor, and if I l=
ose in court then, I just stoke anti-court fervor too,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Jo=
shua A. Geltzer, the director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy =
and Protection at Georgetown, said in an interview. =E2=80=9CIt should be l=
egally impossible as well as factually difficult to do.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The move comes a year after Trump was blocked by the Supreme Court from =
adding a citizenship question to the census on the grounds that its ostensi=
ble reasoning =E2=80=9Cseems to have been contrived.=E2=80=9D The administr=
ation has been trying ever since to collect information on immigrants livin=
g in the country illegally through separate means, like driver=E2=80=99s li=
cense files.</p>
<p>A study last year by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that su=
pports limits on immigration, found that excluding immigrants from the coun=
t for purposes of drawing congressional districts would take away seats fro=
m some states while giving more to others.</p>
<p>Excluding unauthorized immigrants in 2020 would redistribute three seats=
, the study found, with California, New York and Texas all losing a seat th=
at they would have had otherwise, while Ohio, Alabama and Minnesota would e=
ach gain one. The study found even more sweeping effects if the U.S.-born c=
hildren of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally were excluded, but the=
 president=E2=80=99s directive made no mention of them.</p>
<p>Steven Camarota, the research director for the center, said the administ=
ration=E2=80=99s effort would be difficult administratively and likely tied=
 up in court. =E2=80=9CNevertheless,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthe preside=
nt has done the country an important service by reminding us that toleratin=
g large-scale illegal immigration creates a number of unavoidable consequen=
ces, including diluting the political representation of American citizens i=
n Congress and the Electoral College.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The White House separately asked congressional appropriators last weeken=
d to include $1 billion into the next coronavirus relief package for the pu=
rpose of conducting a =E2=80=9Ctimely census.=E2=80=9D The Census Bureau ha=
d previously sought permission to extend the tally of the hardest-to-count =
people into October and delay delivery of reapportionment population totals=
 to next year.</p>
<p>The $1 billion could allow the bureau to abandon that plan and accelerat=
e the counting to deliver a reapportionment count to Congress in December, =
before Trump leaves office if he loses the election to former Vice Presiden=
t Joe Biden. It could mean that less time is devoted to counting the margin=
alized people than in a normal census, which experts believe would benefit =
Republicans.</p>
<p>The president=E2=80=99s directive Tuesday amounted to his latest electio=
n-year effort to restrict immigration and immigration rights in the United =
States, lately predicated on the need to stem the spread of the coronavirus=
.</p>
<p>The administration decided last month to suspend new work visas and bar =
hundreds of thousands of foreigners from seeking employment in the United S=
tates, drawing immediate opposition from business leaders and several state=
s.</p>
<p>But last week administration officials backed away from a separate plan =
to strip international college students of their visas if they did not atte=
nd at least some classes in person. Earlier this month, Trump told Telemund=
o that he would sign a =E2=80=9Cmuch bigger bill on immigration=E2=80=9D th=
rough an executive order, although that has not come to fruition.</p>
<p>The president=E2=80=99s move to exclude immigrants living here illegally=
 from congressional apportionment upends a long history. Even as he signed =
his memorandum Tuesday, the Census Bureau=E2=80=99s own website continued t=
o say in a question-and-answer section that such residents are to be counte=
d: =E2=80=9CYes, all people (citizens and noncitizens) with a usual residen=
ce in the 50 states are to be included in the census and thus in the apport=
ionment counts.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
The president=E2=80=99s policy appeared at odds with the Constitution, whic=
h requires the government to conduct an =E2=80=9Cactual enumeration=E2=80=
=9D of all people living in the United States without distinguishing whethe=
r they are citizens. But the memorandum signed by Trump argued that the gov=
ernment has always made distinctions like not counting foreign diplomats or=
 temporary visitors even though they are in the United States physically. T=
herefore, the memorandum argued, the government can make the further distin=
ction of not counting people who have no legal right to be in the country i=
n the first place.</p>
<p>Critics said the administration=E2=80=99s efforts first to include a cit=
izenship question and now to disregard unauthorized immigrants from apporti=
onment would lead to undercounts of even legal noncitizens and minority res=
idents, resulting in less representation and federal funding in areas where=
 they live, which tend to vote Democratic.</p>
<p>Marielena Hincapi=C3=A9, the executive director of the National Immigrat=
ion Law Center Immigrant Justice Fund, said that regardless of whether Trum=
p=E2=80=99s latest action was legal, it would discourage compliance with th=
e census among Latinos, who already complete the survey at lower rates than=
 people of other races.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThis is his go-to play every time that he=E2=80=99s feeling cor=
nered or he=E2=80=99s feeling like he=E2=80=99s losing,=E2=80=9D Hincapi=C3=
=A9 said. =E2=80=9CHe uses immigrants and immigration to divide and distrac=
t, and at the same time he sends that chilling effect through all immigrant=
 communities who have already been living in fear under his administration.=

<p>NEW YORK =E2=80=94 Hop Kee is a basement Cantonese eatery offering $9.50=
 shrimp lo mein. Hwa Yuan Szechuan is a three-story, white-tablecloth resta=
urant where the whole fish with hot bean sauce is $45.</p>
<p>Both have long histories in Manhattan=E2=80=99s Chinatown, and a deep av=
ersion to delivery apps.</p>
<p>Hop Kee=E2=80=99s owner could not afford the services=E2=80=99 high fees=
. Hwa Yuan=E2=80=99s owner, Chen Lieh Tang, 67, said his cuisine was meant =
to be eaten in one place: Hwa Yuan. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t want people to=
 eat the food cold,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not my style.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>So when the coronavirus pandemic shut down all on-site dining, almost no=
 one was able to enjoy their food, forcing them to confront difficult quest=
ions about modernization and adaptation that may reshape businesses across =
the storied neighborhood.</p>
<p>Since its formation around the 1870s, Chinatown has managed to preserve =
its working-class immigrant character, even as wealth transformed nearly ev=
ery neighborhood around it.</p>
<p>But some of the very traditions that kept Chinatown rooted to its histor=
y have made it one of the neighborhoods most heavily scarred by the pandemi=
c. Now, the economic suffering has intensified a long-simmering generationa=
l divide, between younger people who believe Chinatown must get with the ti=
mes to survive, and older ones who worry about it becoming a theme park of =
Instagrammable desserts and $18 Asian-fusion cocktails.</p>
<p>Chinatown had already seen sharp declines in foot traffic by Lunar New Y=
ear in January, typically its busiest season, because of anti-Chinese xenop=
hobia linked to the virus and because of a slowdown in tourism. When the ci=
ty shut down in March and customers largely stayed home, old-school Chinato=
wn shops were particularly exposed.</p>
<p>Many could not rely on deliveries or curbside pickups, the only transact=
ions permitted for businesses in recent months. (On June 22, the city began=
 allowing limited in-store shopping, as well as outdoor dining, which is a =
rarity in Chinatown.) Only 38% of storefronts in Chinatown had an online pr=
esence, compared with more than 70% in wealthier neighborhoods like the Wes=
t Village, according to an analysis by Live XYZ, a mapping tech company.</p=
>
<p>Nearly a third of Chinatown restaurants are cash-only, according to data=
 from the review site Yelp, and most shunned delivery apps because of their=
 fees. They were accustomed to a business model reliant on high-volume, low=
-priced dishes like $7 noodle soups served to local residents and workers.<=
/p>
<p>Some businesses like Hop Kee, which has been owned by the same family fo=
r five decades, are holding the line.</p>
<p>The restaurant=E2=80=99s cash register and waiters=E2=80=99 uniforms hav=
e stayed the same since the 1970s. Hop Kee doesn=E2=80=99t take credit card=
s.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, it would be packed to capacity with 160 diners on a=
 Saturday night. Now it serves about 20 takeout orders a day for diners who=
 order in person or call Hop Kee=E2=80=99s phone number.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not about making money if you=E2=80=99re here for =
the long term,=E2=80=9D said the owner, Peter Lee, 56. =E2=80=9CIf you go o=
ld-school style, people will look at you like, there=E2=80=99s more truth t=
o this. There=E2=80=99s no sense of authenticity in the digital world.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>Other restaurants, including Hwa Yuan, are embracing the iPhone age, usu=
ally at the urging of younger generations.</p>
<p>Hwa Yuan has a special place in this country=E2=80=99s culinary history:=
 Tang=E2=80=99s father was revered as the chef who introduced Americans to =
cold sesame noodles.</p>
<p>When the shutdown began, Tang=E2=80=99s son, James, 35, insisted that th=
e restaurant sign up for delivery apps. Now Hwa Yuan can be ordered via Gru=
bhub and DoorDash.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe basically had to twist his arm,=E2=80=9D said James Tang, an=
 investment banker. The restaurant has suffered $1 million in losses during=
 the pandemic, but, the elder Tang said, =E2=80=9Cat least there=E2=80=99s =
hope.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>All kinds of Chinatown businesses have been facing similar choices. Foot=
 traffic was slow at Po Wing Hong, a specialty grocery with a focus on drie=
d seafood and Chinese herbs, so Sophia Ng Tsao, 37, has persuaded her paren=
ts, who opened the business in 1980, to start an online store.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s important to diversify your customer base, getting=
 that younger customer, but we=E2=80=99ll do it slowly and organically,=E2=
=80=9D Tsao said. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s a struggle for any multigenerationa=
l business.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Before the virus, walking into parts of Chinatown was the rare Manhattan=
 experience of feeling transported to a different country frozen in time. T=
he sidewalks overflowed with tourists and local shoppers crowding around st=
reet vendors and seafood markets, a lively cacophony of sounds and smells.<=
/p>
<p>At the pandemic=E2=80=99s peak in April, entire streets had become ghost=
 towns of metal shutters. When Phase 2 of the city=E2=80=99s reopening bega=
n on June 22, only about half of the 46 businesses on a three-block stretch=
 of Mott Street, the heart of Chinatown, were open. Barbershops offering $9=
 haircuts had long lines, while other stores had darkened interiors and emp=
loyees lingering at their entrances.</p>
<p>Many businesses were unable to avail themselves of emergency, government=
-backed loans because of delays caused by an initial lack of translation of=
 the paperwork, and because some businesses only keep accounting records on=
 paper, according to community advocates.</p>
<p>Longtime residents say they understand when businesses try to survive by=
 diversifying their clientele, especially if those customers explore other =
stores in the area. But they also worry about trendier establishments turni=
ng the neighborhood into a caricature of Chinatown.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey do attract a crowd that=E2=80=99s less respectful of the c=
ulture or don=E2=80=99t appreciate it,=E2=80=9D said Geoff Lee, 68, a lifel=
ong Chinatown resident. =E2=80=9CThey look at Chinatown more as a novelty t=
han a true identity.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
Perhaps no other business has been as boundary-pushing, and controversial t=
o neighborhood stalwarts, as Nom Wah Tea Parlor, which opened in 1920 and w=
as taken over by the previous owner=E2=80=99s nephew, Wilson Tang, in 2011.=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve been told that I=E2=80=99m a sellout,=E2=80=9D Tan=
g, 41, said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve also been told I=E2=80=99m a beacon of l=
ight.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At Nom Wah, an order of four shrimp dumplings costs $6, twice the price =
at some other spots nearby. Before the pandemic, it was one of the few Chin=
atown restaurants on Caviar, a delivery app for upscale restaurants. The re=
staurant markets its bottled chili oil on Instagram as if it were a sneaker=
 drop.</p>
<p>Nom Wah began selling frozen dumplings online during the pandemic, which=
 helped the business stay afloat this quarter, Wilson Tang said. He hopes t=
he coming release of his cookbook will provide a similar cushion in the fal=
l.</p>
<p>He said Chinatown businesses that can appeal to non-Asian customers are =
better equipped to weather the pandemic.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CChange is inevitable,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIf you don=E2=
=80=99t morph and do better, you=E2=80=99re going to get left behind and di=
e.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
There is no disagreement about the biggest threat to Chinatown: that busine=
sses could close for good. The ripple effects could force small-property ow=
ners to sell to corporate real estate firms that will increase rents and li=
kely bring in stores that offer nothing for immigrant residents.</p>
<p>Geoff Lee=E2=80=99s family has owned properties on Mott Street since the=
 1920s. One of the tenants, a beauty product store, has not paid rent in at=
 least three months, he said.</p>
<p>Developers have already been calling to ask if the family is willing to =
sell. (It is not, said Lee=E2=80=99s brother, Jan.) The neighborhood sits o=
n valuable real estate in Lower Manhattan, surrounded by the wealth of SoHo=
, TriBeCa and the Financial District.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re afraid that the pandemic makes that process of di=
splacement much easier to happen,=E2=80=9D said Jill Sung, 51, chief execut=
ive of Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a community bank whose oldest branch is=
 in Chinatown. =E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t want things to disappear overnight=
. Where=E2=80=99s our history? It breaks that connection.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The neighborhood has already been losing its Chinese residents, even as =
the Chinese and Asian population has grown citywide, with many settling in =
the newer enclaves of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Flushing, Queens.</p>
<p>About 58% of Chinatown=E2=80=99s residents are Asian, according to the l=
atest five-year survey by the Census Bureau, down from about 69% in 2000.</=
p>
<p>Local businesses are also struggling with the prospect that the neighbor=
hood is becoming a retirement community. Among the Asians left in Chinatown=
, the only age group in which the population has increased is those who are=
 65 or older.</p>
<p>Adding another challenge for reopening, the neighborhood=E2=80=99s resta=
urant workers tend to be older and live far from Chinatown.</p>
<p>Jing Fong, an 800-seat dim sum hall, could not begin takeout orders duri=
ng the pandemic until this week, partly because many employees are in a hig=
her-risk age group and were unwilling to commute in, said Truman Lam, the r=
estaurant=E2=80=99s third-generation manager.</p>
<p>The staffing is also a reason the restaurant has struggled to update its=
 computer systems to, for instance, accept gift cards, Lam, 35, said. =E2=
=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s like teaching your parents how to use an iPhone,=E2=80=
=9D he said.
</p><p>
Kenneth Ma, 35, whose family has owned optical stores in Chinatown for four=
 decades, had pushed for the business to go cashless, but his family worrie=
d the switch would drive away older neighbors who depended on them for eye =
exams.</p>
<p>The stores, including Chinatown Optical and Mott Street Optical, have ma=
naged to straddle the old and the modern. They sell affordable metal glasse=
s alongside trendy plastic frames. Every employee speaks Mandarin, Cantones=
e and English.</p>
<p>Ma recently hired an expert in search engine optimization for Mott Stree=
t Optical=E2=80=99s website and is developing a way for customers to try on=
 glasses at home. His mother and uncle became open to these changes, he sai=
d, after the pandemic halted foot traffic from young professionals.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe always ask, who are we for?=E2=80=9D Ma said. =E2=80=9CWe ar=
e for everybody that comes by Chinatown =E2=80=94 whoever lives here, eats =
here, stops by on the weekend. That=E2=80=99s always changing.=E2=80=9D

<p>NEW YORK =E2=80=94 Hop Kee is a basement Cantonese eatery offering $9.50=
 shrimp lo mein. Hwa Yuan Szechuan is a three-story, white-tablecloth resta=
urant where the whole fish with hot bean sauce is $45.</p>
<p>Both have long histories in Manhattan=E2=80=99s Chinatown, and a deep av=
ersion to delivery apps.</p>
<p>Hop Kee=E2=80=99s owner could not afford the services=E2=80=99 high fees=
. Hwa Yuan=E2=80=99s owner, Chen Lieh Tang, 67, said his cuisine was meant =
to be eaten in one place: Hwa Yuan. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t want people to=

=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>So when the coronavirus pandemic shut down all on-site dining, almost no=
 one was able to enjoy their food, forcing them to confront difficult quest=
ions about modernization and adaptation that may reshape businesses across =
the storied neighborhood.</p>
<p>Since its formation around the 1870s, Chinatown has managed to preserve =
its working-class immigrant character, even as wealth transformed nearly ev=
ery neighborhood around it.</p>
<p>But some of the traditions that kept Chinatown rooted to its history hav=
e made it one of the neighborhoods most heavily scarred by the pandemic. No=

ide, between younger people who believe Chinatown must get with the times t=
o survive, and older ones who worry about it becoming a theme park of Insta=
grammable desserts and $18 Asian-fusion cocktails.</p>
<p>Chinatown had already seen sharp declines in foot traffic by Lunar New Y=
ear in January, typically its busiest season, because of anti-Chinese xenop=
hobia linked to the virus and because of a slowdown in tourism. When the ci=
ty shut down in March and customers largely stayed home, old-school Chinato=
wn shops were particularly exposed.</p>
<p>Many could not rely on deliveries or curbside pickups, the only transact=
ions permitted for businesses in recent months. (On June 22, the city began=
 allowing limited in-store shopping, as well as outdoor dining, which is a =
rarity in Chinatown.) Only 38% of storefronts in Chinatown had an online pr=
esence, compared with more than 70% in wealthier neighborhoods like the Wes=
t Village, according to an analysis by Live XYZ, a mapping tech company.</p=
>
<p>Nearly a third of Chinatown restaurants are cash-only, according to data=
 from the review site Yelp, and most shunned delivery apps because of their=
 fees. They were accustomed to a business model reliant on high-volume, low=
-priced dishes like $7 noodle soups served to local residents and workers.<=
/p>
<p>Some businesses like Hop Kee, which has been owned by the same family fo=
r five decades, are holding the line.</p>
<p>The restaurant=E2=80=99s cash register and waiters=E2=80=99 uniforms hav=
e stayed the same since the 1970s. Hop Kee doesn=E2=80=99t take credit card=
s.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, it would be packed to capacity with 160 diners on a=
 Saturday night. Now it serves about 20 takeout orders a day for diners who=
 order in person or call Hop Kee=E2=80=99s phone number.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not about making money if you=E2=80=99re here for =
the long term,=E2=80=9D said the owner, Peter Lee, 56. =E2=80=9CIf you go o=
ld-school style, people will look at you like, there=E2=80=99s more truth t=
o this. There=E2=80=99s no sense of authenticity in the digital world.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p>Other restaurants, including Hwa Yuan, are embracing the iPhone age, usu=
ally at the urging of younger generations.</p>
<p>Hwa Yuan has a special place in this country=E2=80=99s culinary history:=
 Tang=E2=80=99s father was revered as the chef who introduced Americans to =
cold sesame noodles.</p>
<p>After the shutdown, Tang=E2=80=99s son, James, 35, insisted that the res=
taurant sign up for apps. Now Hwa Yuan can be ordered via Grubhub and DoorD=
ash.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe basically had to twist his arm,=E2=80=9D said James Tang, an=
 investment banker. The restaurant has suffered $1 million in losses, but, =
the elder Tang said, =E2=80=9Cat least there=E2=80=99s hope.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>All kinds of Chinatown businesses have been facing similar choices. Foot=
 traffic was slow at Po Wing Hong, a specialty grocery with a focus on drie=
d seafood and Chinese herbs, so Sophia Ng Tsao, 37, has persuaded her paren=
ts, who opened the business in 1980, to start an online store.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s important to diversify your customer base, getting=
 that younger customer, but we=E2=80=99ll do it slowly and organically,=E2=
=80=9D Tsao said. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s a struggle for any multigenerationa=
l business.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Before the virus, walking into parts of Chinatown was the rare Manhattan=
 experience of feeling transported to a place frozen in time. The sidewalks=
 overflowed with tourists and local shoppers crowding around street vendors=
 and seafood markets, a lively cacophony of sounds and smells.</p>
<p>At the pandemic=E2=80=99s peak in April, entire streets had become ghost=
 towns of metal shutters. When Phase 2 of the city=E2=80=99s reopening bega=
n on June 22, only about half of the 46 businesses on a three-block stretch=
 of Mott Street, the heart of Chinatown, were open. Barbershops offering $9=
 haircuts had long lines, while other stores had darkened interiors and emp=
loyees lingering at their entrances.</p>
<p>Many businesses were unable to avail themselves of emergency, government=
-backed loans because of delays caused by an initial lack of translation of=
 the paperwork, and because some businesses only keep accounting records on=
 paper, according to community advocates.</p>
<p>Longtime residents say they understand when businesses try to survive by=
 diversifying their clientele, especially if those customers explore other =
stores in the area. But they also worry about trendier establishments turni=
ng the neighborhood into a caricature of Chinatown.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey do attract a crowd that=E2=80=99s less respectful of the c=
ulture or don=E2=80=99t appreciate it,=E2=80=9D said Geoff Lee, 68, a lifel=
ong Chinatown resident. =E2=80=9CThey look at Chinatown more as a novelty t=
han a true identity.=E2=80=9D
</p><p>
Perhaps no other business has been as boundary-pushing, and controversial t=
o neighborhood stalwarts, as Nom Wah Tea Parlor, which opened in 1920 and w=
as taken over by the previous owner=E2=80=99s nephew, Wilson Tang, in 2011.=
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve been told that I=E2=80=99m a sellout,=E2=80=9D Tan=
g, 41, said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve also been told I=E2=80=99m a beacon of l=
ight.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>At Nom Wah, an order of four shrimp dumplings costs $6, twice the price =
at some other spots nearby. Before the pandemic, it was one of the few Chin=
atown restaurants on Caviar, a delivery app for upscale restaurants.</p>
<p>Nom Wah began selling frozen dumplings online during the pandemic, which=
 helped the business stay afloat this quarter, Wilson Tang said. He hopes t=
he coming release of his cookbook will provide a similar cushion in the fal=
l.</p>
<p>He said Chinatown businesses that can appeal to non-Asian customers are =
better equipped to weather the crisis.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CChange is inevitable,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIf you don=E2=
=80=99t morph and do better, you=E2=80=99re going to get left behind and di=
e.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>
There is no disagreement about the biggest threat to Chinatown: that busine=
sses could close for good. The ripple effects could force small-property ow=
ners to sell to corporate real estate firms that will increase rents and li=
kely bring in stores that offer nothing for immigrant residents.</p>
<p>Geoff Lee=E2=80=99s family has owned properties on Mott Street since the=
 1920s. One of the tenants, a beauty products store, has not paid rent in a=
t least three months, he said.</p>
<p>Developers have already been calling to ask if the family is willing to =
sell. (It is not, said Lee=E2=80=99s brother, Jan.) The neighborhood sits o=
n valuable real estate in Lower Manhattan, surrounded by the wealth of SoHo=
, TriBeCa and the Financial District.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re afraid that the pandemic makes that process of di=
splacement much easier to happen,=E2=80=9D said Jill Sung, 51, chief execut=
ive of Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a community bank whose oldest branch is=
 in Chinatown. =E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t want things to disappear overnight=
. Where=E2=80=99s our history? It breaks that connection.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>The neighborhood has already been losing its Chinese residents, even as =
the Chinese and Asian population has grown citywide, with many settling in =
the newer enclaves of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Flushing, Queens.</p>
<p>About 58% of Chinatown=E2=80=99s residents are Asian, according to the l=
atest five-year survey by the Census Bureau, down from about 69% in 2000.</=
p>
<p>Local businesses are also struggling with the prospect that the neighbor=
hood is becoming a retirement community. Among the Asians left in Chinatown=
, the only age group in which the population has increased is those who are=
 65 or older.</p>
<p>Adding another challenge for reopening, the neighborhood=E2=80=99s resta=
urant workers tend to be older and live far from Chinatown.</p>
<p>Jing Fong, an 800-seat dim sum hall, could not begin takeout orders duri=
ng the pandemic until this week, partly because many employees are in a hig=
her-risk age group and were unwilling to commute in, said Truman Lam, the r=
estaurant=E2=80=99s third-generation manager.</p>
<p>The staffing is also a reason the restaurant has struggled to update its=
 computer systems to, for instance, accept gift cards, Lam, 35, said. =E2=
=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s like teaching your parents how to use an iPhone,=E2=80=
=9D he said.
</p><p>
Kenneth Ma, 35, whose family has owned optical stores in Chinatown for four=
 decades, had pushed for the business to go cashless, but his family worrie=
d that the switch would drive away older neighbors who depended on them for=
 eye exams.</p>
<p>The stores, including Chinatown Optical and Mott Street Optical, have ma=
naged to straddle the old and the modern. They sell affordable metal glasse=
s alongside trendy plastic frames. Every employee speaks Mandarin, Cantones=
e and English.</p>
<p>Ma recently hired an expert in search engine optimization for Mott Stree=
t Optical=E2=80=99s website and is developing a way for customers to try on=
 glasses at home. His mother and uncle became open to these changes, he sai=
d, after the pandemic halted foot traffic from young professionals.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe always ask, who are we for?=E2=80=9D Ma said. =E2=80=9CWe ar=
e for everybody that comes by Chinatown =E2=80=94 whoever lives here, eats =
here, stops by on the weekend. That=E2=80=99s always changing.=E2=80=9D

eau's standards and it showed an unmistakable moment in America's future: t=
he year 2044, when white Americans were projected to fall below half the po=
pulation and lose their majority status.</p><p>The presentation of the data=
 disturbed Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director, who saw it whi=
le looking through a government report. The graphic made demographic change=
 look like a zero-sum game that white Americans were losing, he thought, an=
d could provoke a political backlash.</p><p>So after the report's release t=
hree years ago, he organized a meeting with Katherine Wallman, at the time =
the chief statistician for the United States.</p><p>&quot;I said 'I'm reall=
y worried about this,&quot;' said Dr. Prewitt, now a professor of public af=
fairs at Columbia University. He added, &quot;Statistics are powerful. They=
 are a description of who we are as a country. If you say majority-minority=
, that becomes a huge fact in the national discourse.&quot;</p><p>In a nati=
on preoccupied by race, the moment when white Americans will make up less t=
han half the country's population has become an object of fascination.</p><=
p>For white nationalists, it signifies a kind of doomsday clock counting do=
wn to the end of racial and cultural dominance. For progressives who seek a=
n end to Republican power, the year points to inevitable political triumph,=
 when they imagine voters of color will rise up and hand victories to the D=
emocratic Party.</p><p>But many academics have grown increasingly uneasy wi=
th the public fixation. They point to recent research demonstrating the dat=
a's power to shape perceptions. Some are questioning the assumptions the Ce=
nsus Bureau is making about race, and whether projecting the American popul=
ation even makes sense at a time of rapid demographic change when the categ=
ories themselves seem to be shifting.</p><p>Jennifer Richeson, a social psy=
chologist at Yale University, spotted the risk immediately. As an analyst o=
f group behavior, she knew that group size was a marker of dominance and th=
at a group getting smaller could feel threatened. At first she thought the =
topic of a declining white majority was too obvious to study.</p><p>But she=
 did, together with a colleague, Maureen Craig, a social psychologist at Ne=
w York University, and they have been talking about the results ever since.=
 Their findings, first published in 2014, showed that white Americans who w=
ere randomly assigned to read about the racial shift were more likely to re=
port negative feelings toward racial minorities than those who were not. Th=
ey were also more likely to support restrictive immigration policies and to=
 say that whites would likely lose status and face discrimination in the fu=
ture.</p><p>Mary Waters, a sociologist at Harvard University, remembered be=
ing stunned when she saw the research.</p><p>&quot;It was like, 'Oh wow, th=
ese nerdy projections are scaring the hell out of people,&quot; she said.</=
p><p>Beyond concerns about the data's repercussions, some researchers are a=
lso questioning whether the Census Bureau's projections provide a true pict=
ure. At issue, they say, is whom the government counts as white.</p><p>In t=
he Census Bureau's projections, people of mixed race or ethnicity have been=
 counted mostly as minority, demographers say. This has had the effect of u=
nderstating the size of the white population, they say, because many Americ=
ans with one white parent may identify as white or partly white. On their c=
ensus forms, Americans can choose more than one race and whether they are o=
f Hispanic origin.</p><p>Among Asians and Hispanics, more than a quarter ma=
rry outside their race, according to the Pew Research Center. For American-=
born Asians, the share is nearly double that. It means that mixed-race peop=
le may be a small group now -- around 7 percent of the population, accordin=
g to  Pew  -- but will steadily grow. Are those children white? Are they mi=
nority? Are they both? What about the grandchildren?</p><p>&quot;The questi=
on really for us as a society is there are all these people who look white,=
 act white, marry white and live white, so what does white even mean anymor=
e?&quot; Dr. Waters said. &quot;We are in a really interesting time, an ind=
eterminate time, when we are not policing the boundary very strongly.&quot;=
</p><p>The Census Bureau has long produced projections of the American popu=
lation, but they were rarely the topic of talk shows or newspaper headlines=
.</p><p>Then, in August 2008 at the height of Barack Obama's campaign for p=
resident, the bureau projected that non-Hispanic whites would drop below ha=
lf the population by 2042, far earlier than expected. (The projections, whi=
ch change with birth, death and migration rates, have also placed the shift=
 in 2050 and in 2044.)</p><p>&quot;That's what really lit the fuse,&quot; s=
aid Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California, r=
eferring to the 2008 projection. &quot;People went crazy.&quot;</p><p>It wa=
s not just white nationalists worried about losing racial dominance. Dr. My=
ers watched as progressives, envisioning political power, became enamored w=
ith the idea of a coming white minority. He said it was hard to interest th=
em in his work on ways to make the change seem less threatening to fearful =
white Americans -- for instance by emphasizing the good that could come fro=
m immigration.</p><p>&quot;It was conquest, our day has come,&quot; he said=
 of their reaction. &quot;They wanted to overpower them with numbers. It wa=
s demographic destiny.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Myers and a colleague later found th=
at presenting the data differently could produce a much less anxious reacti=
on. In work published this spring, they found that the negative effects tha=
t came from reading about a white decline were largely erased when the same=
 people read about how the white category was in fact getting bigger by abs=
orbing multiracial young people through intermarriage.</p><p>It is unclear =
exactly when the idea of a majority-minority crossover first appeared, but =
several experts said it may have surfaced in connection with the 1965 Votin=
g Rights Act.</p><p>Ms. Wallman, the chief statistician for the United Stat=
es from 1992 to 2017, who helped develop the first governmentwide standard =
for data on race and ethnicity that came into use in the late 1970s, said s=
he did not like having to categorize by race, but that the government had t=
o for oversight.</p><p>&quot;I wish we didn't have to ask,&quot; she said. =
&quot;But to me, that's the rock and the hard place.&quot;</p><p>Race is di=
fficult to count because, unlike income or employment, it is a social categ=
ory that shifts with changes in culture, immigration, and ideas about genet=
ics. So who counts as white has changed over time. In the 1910s and 1920s, =
the last time immigrants were such a large share of the American population=
, there were furious arguments over how to categorize newcomers from Europe=
.</p><p>But eventually, the immigrants from eastern and southern Europe cam=
e to be considered white.</p><p>That is because race is about power, not bi=
ology, said Charles King, a political science professor at Georgetown Unive=
rsity.</p><p>&quot;The closer you get to social power, the closer you get t=
o whiteness,&quot; said Dr. King, author of a coming book on Franz Boas, th=
e early 20th-century anthropologist who argued against theories of racial d=
ifference. The one group that was never allowed to cross the line into whit=
eness was African-Americans, he said -- the long-term legacy of slavery.</p=
><p>To Richard Alba, a sociologist at the City University of New York, the =
Census Bureau's projections seemed stuck in an outdated classification syst=
em. The bureau assigns a nonwhite label to most people who are reported as =
having both white and minority ancestry, he said. He likened this to the on=
e-drop rule, a 19th-century system of racial classification in which having=
 even one African ancestor meant you were black.</p><p>&quot;The census dat=
a is distorting the on-the-ground realities of ethnicity and race,&quot; Dr=
. Alba said. &quot;There might never be a majority-minority society; it's u=
nclear.&quot;</p><p>Asked for a response to Dr. Alba's critique, a Census B=
ureau spokesman said in an email that &quot;we constantly consult with stak=
eholders, and scholars, including Richard Alba and other federal agencies t=
o improve our techniques, methodologies, and testing of population projecti=
ons.&quot;</p><p>William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, =
argued that the Census Bureau was doing the best that it could at a time wh=
en society was changing quickly. He was skeptical that today's Asians and H=
ispanics were analogous to the white ethnic Americans of the 20th century, =
and believed that a less conservative count would not do much to change the=
 bigger picture. Besides, it is not the job of academics to protect people =
from demographic change, he said.</p><p>&quot;Irrespective of the year, or =
the turning point, the message needs to come out about what the actual fact=
s are,&quot; Mr. Frey said. &quot;We are becoming a much more racially dive=
rse society among our young generation.&quot;</p><p>Others say they are not=
 sugarcoating statistics, but showing that the numbers have many interpreta=
tions, and that white-versus-everyone-else is only one. It not only reduces=
 the American patchwork to a crude, divisive political formula, they say, b=
ut perhaps more important -- with the categories in flux -- it might not ev=
en be true.</p><p>The Census Bureau released new projections this year in M=
arch filled with data about the country's future. In the coming decades, ad=
ults 65 and older will outnumber children for the first time in the country=
's history. The share of mixed-race children is set to double.</p><p>But th=
ere was no mention of a year when white Americans would fall below half the=
 population.</p><p>When asked about the change, a spokesman for the Bureau =
said: &quot;It was just us getting back to sticking to data.&quot;</p><div>=

public officials are expressing growing concerns that the bedrock mission o=
f the 2020 census -- an accurate and trustworthy head count of everyone in =
the United States -- is imperiled, with worrisome implications.<p>Preparati=
ons for the count already are complicated by a sea change in the census its=
elf: For the first time, it will be conducted largely online instead of by =
mail.</p>
<p>But as the Census Bureau ramps up its spending and work force for the 20=
20 count, it is saddled with problems. Its two top administrative posts are=
 filled by placeholders. Years of underfunding by Congress and cost overrun=
s on the digital transition have forced the agency to pare back its prepara=
tions, including abandoning two of the three trial runs of the overhauled c=
ensus process.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates also fear that the Trump administration is inj=
ecting political considerations into the bureau, a rigidly nonpartisan agen=
cy whose population count will be the basis for redrawing congressional and=
 state legislative districts in the early 2020s. And there is broad agreeme=
nt that the administration's aggressive enforcement of immigration policies=
 will make it even harder to reach minorities, undocumented immigrants and =
others whose numbers have long been undercounted.</p>
<p>Taken together, some experts say, those issues substantially raise the r=
isk that the 2020 count could be flawed, disputed, or both.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a set of unprecedented challenges that collectively threat=
en to create a perfect storm in 2020,&quot; Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consulta=
nt and a leading authority on the census, said in an interview. &quot;If pu=
blic confidence in the objectivity and quality of the 2020 census erodes, t=
hen another pillar of our representative democracy could be compromised.&qu=
ot;</p>
<p>John H. Thompson, who led the Census Bureau from 2013 until June, said t=
he agency appeared on track to conduct its crucial and only &quot;end-to-en=
d&quot; dry run of the count in Providence, R.I., in April. &quot;The caree=
r staff at the Census Bureau are really, really good and really committed t=
o an accurate count,&quot; he said. &quot;They will do the best job they ca=
n for the money and public cooperation they get.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, he added, &quot;There's an issue with funding, and there's an iss=
ue with operational readiness. And there's an issue with accuracy.&quot;</p=
>
<p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a onetime census-taker himself, said in =
a statement on Saturday that he was &quot;keenly aware&quot; of the challen=
ges facing the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and=
 that he had put in place new management to address some of the 2020 issues=
. The top acting officials at the bureau are career employees with decades =
of experience; with those changes and more money, he said, &quot;I am confi=
dent in our ability to conduct a full, fair and accurate 2020 census.&quot;=
</p>
<p>A department spokesman, James Rockas, noted that Mr. Ross was seeking ne=
arly $750 million for advertising and outreach programs to persuade members=
 of hard-to-reach groups to participate. The Obama administration had &quot=
;severely underestimated&quot; both the cost and technical challenges of mo=
ving to a digital census, he said. Outside experts disputed that charge, no=
ting that Congress had ordered the Census Bureau to spend no more than $13 =
billion on the 2020 census, and then cut even more from Obama administratio=
n budget requests that sought to meet that mandate.</p>
<p>Consternation about pulling off an accurate count has been part of the r=
un-up to past censuses, especially regarding funding challenges. During the=
 last census, worries ranged from undercounting military personnel and thei=
r families on bases to fairly accounting for large inmate populations in ru=
ral Republican districts.</p>
<p>A bungled count could have profound consequences. Data from the census -=
- which aims to count everyone, whether citizens or not -- dictate the dist=
ribution of more than $600 billion yearly in grants and subsidies to state =
and local governments. Demographic data from the count are the bases for su=
rveys that are benchmarks for major businesses, governments and researchers=
.</p>
<p>The census results also will determine which states will gain or lose se=
ats in the House of Representatives and how those lines are drawn when redi=
stricting begins in 2021. Serious undercounts would invite lawsuits that co=
uld hogtie that process, some experts said, and sap public trust in one of =
the government's core functions.</p>
<p>The census is the gold standard of data collection not just in the Unite=
d States but in the world, said Phil Sparks, a director of the Census Proje=
ct, a network of organizations promoting an accurate head count in 2020. &q=
uot;The last thing we want to do in this current debate,&quot; he said, &qu=
ot;is to make this a base metal.&quot;</p>
<p>The bureau has been working on the 2020 count since the 2010 census was =
completed. The complete overhaul now underway seeks to shrink the count's c=
ostliest and toughest task: sending hundreds of thousands of enumerators to=
 find and interview the millions of people who fail to fill out their censu=
s forms.</p>
<p>An online head count, the reasoning goes, should reach more households m=
ore efficiently than mailed forms. The enumerators who track down those who=
 do not respond (in 2010, almost 3 in 10 households) will use smartphone ap=
ps that instantly send data to the bureau's computers and track the canvass=
ers' progress.</p>
<p>The bureau also hopes to mine federal databases and even satellite image=
s for information that could reduce wasted trips by enumerators -- to vacan=
t buildings, for example -- and automatically fill in personal data like ad=
dresses and ages.</p>
<p>The goal is to rein in the ballooning cost of censuses, from $1.22 per p=
erson counted in 1970 to more than $42 in 2010. Paradoxically, however, Con=
gress's demand to keep the 2020 census within the $13 billion cost of the 2=
010 tally backfired, as the underfunded shift to a digital census only led =
to later cost overruns, including $300 million for a key initiative to cent=
ralize data processing.</p>
<p>Compounding that, Congress has regularly given the agency less money tha=
n it said was needed -- $200 million less through fiscal 2017 -- forcing of=
ficials to slow or eliminate programs.</p>
<p>It also has canceled dry runs of the completed census process in Washing=
ton State and West Virginia that would have documented its performance in r=
ural areas with spotty internet service and Indian reservations that do not=
 use standard addresses. It has abandoned plans for smartphone canvasses in=
 group living quarters like college dorms and prisons, and scaled back its =
culling of information from federal databases.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department has raised the count's projected cost to $15.6 b=
illion, including a $1.2 billion emergency fund -- still less, it said, tha=
n the $17 billion a mail-in census would have cost. Secretary Ross asked Co=
ngress in October for an extra $3.3 billion to fund that new budget. But wh=
ile outsiders applauded his commitment to the census, they were uncertain t=
hat the White House shared it.</p>
<p>To some experts, the situation recalls the 2010 census, in which the bur=
eau sought to equip its enumerators with digital devices, fell behind sched=
ule and had to spend $3 billion on a last-minute switch to pencil-and-paper=
 forms.</p>
<p>&quot;We basically have a simple choice,&quot; said Representative Carol=
yn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat who has proposed legislation adding abou=
t $440 million to the bureau's fiscal 2018 budget. &quot;Properly fund the =
census now, or ask the taxpayers to pay a lot more down the road to make up=
 for poor planning.&quot;</p>
<p>But at least as worrisome as funding is concern over the Trump administr=
ation's impact on the 2020 count.</p>
<p>For different reasons, both civil liberties advocates and census experts=
 say they are troubled by the White House's purported interest in Thomas Br=
unell, a political-science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, =
for the bureau's vacant post of deputy director. Mr. Brunell, a scholar of =
redistricting, has been an expert witness for Republican defendants in seve=
ral gerrymandering cases. He also has criticized the policy of statisticall=
y adjusting census results to account for minorities and others who are und=
ercounted.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Brunell nor the Trump administration has addressed that inte=
rest, first reported in Politico. Former officials of the bureau said in in=
terviews that Mr. Brunell lacked managerial experience for a position long =
held by experienced executives. Civil rights advocates said they worried th=
at his appointment would signal partisan meddling in a census whose usefuln=
ess in drawing legislative districts depends entirely on its credibility.</=
p>
<p>The deputy director runs the bureau's daily operations and is a key voic=
e in census decisions. Liberals fear a partisan leader would scale back eff=
orts to reach minorities and other Democratic-leaning groups that already a=
re undercounted. Others said low-income and older rural residents who are r=
eliably Republican also are undercounted, and that the issue was not so muc=
h partisanship as accuracy and credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;The politicization of the census would erode what is already fragi=
le trust and confidence in the integrity of the count,&quot; said Vanita Gu=
pta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, =
which has worked for years on census issues.</p>
<p>The Trump administration's heated rhetoric on immigration, race and the =
trustworthiness of government is fueling fears that minorities, legal and u=
ndocumented immigrants and others -- from asylum-seekers to victims of the =
opioid crisis -- will be even harder to locate and count. The 2010 census a=
ctually overcounted non-Hispanic whites by 0.8 percent and undercounted Afr=
ican-Americans by 2.1 percent and Hispanics by 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>Suggestions by Mr. Trump and others that the census include a question a=
bout citizenship or immigration status are especially worrying to many. Mor=
e than 11 million undocumented immigrants lived in the United States in 201=
6, eight million of them in the civilian work force. The administration's h=
ard line on immigration already is having a chilling effect on Hispanic lea=
ders whose support is crucial to an accurate count, said Arturo Vargas, the=
 executive director of the Naleo Education Fund, which promotes Latino invo=
lvement in civic life.</p>
<p>&quot;Our membership includes elected officials and other people who hav=
e indicated they're not convinced that they can stand up with confidence an=
d tell their constituents that filling out the census form is safe and conf=
idential,&quot; said Mr. Vargas, who sits on a census advisory committee on=
 issues that affect minorities and other hard-to-count groups. &quot;There'=
s just a great lack of confidence now.&quot;</p>
<p>A marked undercount, especially one that appeared driven by partisanship=
, could spark an unsettling battle between the census's political winners a=
nd losers. There is precedent: Article 1 of the Constitution requires a dec=
ennial census for reapportionment purposes. But after Republicans took cont=
rol of Congress and the White House in 1920, the House of Representatives r=
efused to allow reapportionment of House seats, fearing that the rapid urba=
nization the census had documented would shift political power from rural a=
reas to cities.</p>
<p>A similar refusal to accept the 2020 census's results &quot;by definitio=
n would be a constitutional crisis,&quot; Ms. Lowenthal said. And any loss =
in faith in the count -- whether due to politics, money or poor planning --=
 would do lasting damage, she and others said.</p>
<p>&quot;The record of the census in counting people from all income groups=
, all racial and ethnic groups, is really extraordinary,&quot; said Steve H=
. Murdock, a Rice University sociologist who led the Census Bureau under Pr=
esident George W. Bush. &quot;Once you break that belief in the activity, i=
t's hard to replace.&quot;</p>

<body>              <p>WASHINGTON --  President Obama last week sought to t=
urn attention from health care to immigration -- in other words, from one r=
acially divisive issue to another.</p>              <p>Whites tend to hold =
negative views of Obamacare, while blacks tend to like it. Specifically, 55=
 percent of whites, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found this year, c=
onsider Mr. Obama's health care law a bad idea, while 59 percent of blacks =
call it a good idea. On immigration, 51 percent of whites oppose legal stat=
us for illegal residents, but 63 percent of blacks and 76 percent of Hispan=
ics favor it.</p>              <p>The statistics mirror the core philosophi=
cal division in Washington's fierce battles over taxes, spending and debt. =
Whites say government does too much, while blacks and Hispanics say it shou=
ld do more to meet people's needs.</p>              <p>Those attitudes, and=
 the continued growth of the nonwhite population, have produced this someti=
mes-overlooked result: American politics has grown increasingly polarized b=
y race, as well as by party and ideology.</p>              <p>That reality =
promises to command more attention as the day draws closer when whites will=
 no longer make up a majority of the population, which the Census Bureau pr=
ojects will be in 2043.</p>              <p>Race receded from public dialog=
ue in the mid-1990s for reasons that served both parties. Republicans grew =
fearful of criticism of the racially charged tactics that began with Richar=
d M. Nixon's &quot;Southern strategy.&quot; And a Democratic president -- B=
ill Clinton -- and a Republican Congress overhauled welfare, draining racia=
l electricity from partisan combat. By 2008, Mr. Obama sought to dial back =
talk of race in his campaign to become America's first black president.</p>=
              <p>Now two factors have combined to raise the racial volume. =
First, the growing voting strength and allegiance of black, Hispanic and As=
ian-Americans have made nonwhites an increasing share of the Democratic coa=
lition. Second, conservative whites are bitterly resisting both Mr. Obama a=
nd his agenda.</p>              <p>Thus a crucial variable before last Nove=
mber's election was the racial composition of the electorate. As the Obama =
team predicted, the proportion of white voters fell to 72 percent. The pres=
ident won by drawing eight in 10 black, Hispanic and Asian-American votes, =
even as Mitt Romney won six in 10 white votes.</p>              <p>Electora=
l geography punctuated those disparities with historical resonance. In the =
11 states of the Confederacy, Mr. Romney outpolled Mr. Obama by nine percen=
tage points. Elsewhere, Mr. Obama won by 10 points.</p>              <p>Aga=
inst that backdrop, Congressional Republicans have pursued cuts in food sta=
mp spending, and Republican-controlled state legislatures have enacted vote=
r-identification laws. A Republican official in North Carolina recently res=
igned after telling a &quot;Daily Show&quot; interviewer that ID cards coul=
d diminish voting by &quot;a bunch of lazy blacks that wants the government=
 to give them everything.&quot;</p>              <p>Senator Rand Paul, Repu=
blican of Kentucky, wrote his 2011 book, &quot;The Tea Party Goes to Washin=
gton,&quot; with a former radio host known as the Southern Avenger who wore=
 a mask decorated with the Confederate flag. This summer, the co-author lef=
t his job as the senator's social media director after news reports emerged=
 about that earlier work.</p>              <p>Stanley Greenberg, a pollster=
 for Mr. Clinton and other Democrats, said that recent focus groups among c=
ore Republican voters highlighted anxiety that &quot;big government is mean=
t to create rights and dependency and electoral support from mostly minorit=
ies who will reward the Democratic Party with their votes.&quot;</p>       =
       <p>&quot;While few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the =
base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing=
 minorities,&quot; Mr. Greenberg wrote. &quot;The base thinks they are losi=
ng politically and losing control of the country.&quot;</p>              <p=
>One risk for Democrats is reacting to those cultural fears with stridency,=
 as Representative Alan Grayson of Florida did recently in likening the Tea=
 Party to the Ku Klux Klan, drawing a rebuke from the Democratic Party's na=
tional chairwoman. </p>              <p>Some Republicans strike similar cho=
rds. In Kentucky, an ally of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader=
, hit Mr. McConnell's Tea Party-backed primary challenger for having once s=
upported a third-party presidential candidate &quot;found on YouTube giving=
 a lengthy speech in front of the third national flag of the Confederate St=
ates of America.&quot;</p>              <p>Fred Steeper, a Republican polls=
ter who advised both Presidents Bush, worries about renewed attention to ra=
cial divisions for two reasons.</p>              <p>One is that it could ta=
int what he calls the Republican Party's &quot;legitimate argument&quot; in=
 favor of self-reliance and smaller government. The other is the difficulty=
 of winning national elections if the party's hard-line on immigration cont=
inues to alienate Hispanics. &quot;Racism may be a part of it,&quot; especi=
ally among working-class whites, Mr. Steeper said of the immigration stance=
. &quot;The Republican Party needs to stop pandering to that.&quot;</p>    =
          <p>He added, &quot;The Republican Party needs to throw in the tow=
el on the immigration issue.&quot;</p>              <p>The Democrats' probl=
em is winning over whites. At the moment that's a challenge of governance -=
- as Mr. Obama's struggle to implement his health law demonstrates. &quot;T=
he challenge we have with the health care law is similar to the challenge w=
e've had in our politics more broadly,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a recent int=
erview. &quot;There have been caricatures of what we're trying to do.&quot;=
</p>              <p>Most uninsured Americans who will be helped by the law=
, he added, &quot;are going to be white.&quot;</p>              <p>The risk=
 for the country is heightened racial tensions. Mr. Obama's advisers play d=
own that prospect for the long term, noting younger Americans' instinct for=
 tolerance. &quot;As rising generations replace older ones,&quot; a study b=
y the liberal Center for American Progress concluded last week, &quot;conce=
rns about rising diversity will recede.&quot;</p>              <p>In the me=
antime, Mr. Steeper hopes Republicans can persuade more Hispanics, Asian-Am=
ericans and blacks to align with their message of opportunity. &quot;We sho=
uld have two parties based on a different approach to the role of governmen=
t,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't want our parties to be representing racial =
groups.&quot;</p>            </body>          </html></Text></p><p style=3D=

, and every 10 years since, the census has sorted the American population i=
nto distinct racial groups. Remarkably, a discredited relic of 18th-century=
 science, the &quot;five races of mankind,&quot; lives on in the 21st centu=
ry. Today, the census calls these five races white; black; American Indian =
or Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. </p=
>              <p>The nation's founders put a hierarchical racial classific=
ation to political use: its premise of white supremacy justified, among oth=
er things, enslaving Africans, violent removal of Native Americans from the=
ir land, the colonization of Caribbean and Pacific islands, Jim Crow subjug=
ation and the importation of cheap labor from China and Mexico.</p>        =
      <p>Of course, officially sanctioned discrimination was finally outlaw=
ed by civil rights legislation in 1964. The underlying demographic categori=
es, however, were kept. Securing civil rights required statistics. Thus res=
ulted an uneasy marriage of preposterous 18th-century racial classification=
s to legitimate 20th-century policy goals like fair electoral representatio=
n, anti-discrimination programs, school desegregation, bilingual education =
and affirmative action. </p>              <p>But the demographic revolution=
 since the immigration overhaul of 1965 has pushed the outdated (and politi=
cally constructed) notion of race to the breaking point. In June the Suprem=
e Court struck down a core provision of the Voting Rights Act, taking note =
of changing demographics. I disagree with the court's ruling, but agree tha=
t society is changing. And our statistics must reflect those changes.</p>  =
            <p>Fast-growing population groups -- mixed-race Americans, thos=
e with &quot;hyphenated&quot; identities, immigrants and their children, an=
yone under 30 -- increasingly complain that the choices offered by the cens=
us are too limited, even ludicrous. Particularly tortured is the Census Bur=
eau's designation, since 1970, of &quot;Hispanic&quot; as an ethnicity or o=
rigin, thereby compelling Hispanics to also choose a &quot;race.&quot; In 2=
010, Hispanics were offered the option to select more than one race, but 37=
 percent opted for &quot;some other race&quot; -- a telling indicator that =
the term itself is the problem. </p>              <p>Indeed, anyone who fil=
led in &quot;some other race&quot; that year was allocated to one or more o=
f the five main groupings. Many absurdities have resulted. </p>            =
  <p>America has about 1.5 million immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa -- so=
me 3 percent of the nation's black population. Like President Obama's fathe=
r, who was Kenyan, their experience differs vastly from that of African-Ame=
ricans whose ancestors were enslaved, yet they are subsumed into the same c=
ategory -- one that, until this very year, continued to include the outdate=
d term &quot;Negro.&quot; </p>              <p>The census considers Arabs w=
hite, along with non-Arabs like Turks and Kurds because they have origins i=
n the Middle East or North Africa. Migrants from the former Soviet nations =
in Central Asia are lumped in as white along with descendants of New Englan=
d pilgrims. </p>              <p>An indigenous person from Peru, Bolivia or=
 Guatemala is Hispanic, but if she &quot;maintains tribal affiliation or co=
mmunity attachment,&quot; she might also be counted as part of a racial gro=
up that includes the Inupiat and Yupik peoples of Alaska.</p>              =
<p>Are Australian immigrants whites or Pacific Islanders? (The Census Burea=
u's own documents are unclear on this.) </p>              <p>The census has=
 no second-generation question, leaving Congress to debate immigration refo=
rm with inadequate statistics about which new Americans are learning Englis=
h, finishing school, living in segregated neighborhoods or staying out of j=
ail. Social scientists closely track intermarriage as an indicator of assim=
ilation, but the census reports intermarriage only among whites, blacks, Hi=
spanics and others -- overlooking unions between, say, Japanese and Chinese=
, Cubans and Mexicans, Nigerians and native-born blacks. These marriages ma=
y have as much to tell us about where the nation is headed as the rate at w=
hich whites intermarry.</p>              <p>Much attention has been paid to=
 the news that non-Hispanic whites now account for less than half of births=
 in the United States  and that deaths now exceed births among non-Hispanic=
 whites. These projections are oversimplified and misleading because they r=
ely on the outdated &quot;five races&quot; concept. The far more significan=
t turning point is the shift from a nation of a few large racial blocs into=
 a hybrid America of numerous nationalities, ethnicities and cultures, unpr=
ecedented in human history. It is this hybrid, multivalent, dynamic America=
 that is not reflected in the census. We cannot, however, fix this at the e=
xpense of abandoning racial categories, which are still needed for legitima=
te policy purposes. </p>              <p>The Census Bureau has begun to con=
sider what changes it will recommend for the 2020 census. It will focus, ap=
propriately, on operational improvements, like increasing response rates. B=
ut there are also political decisions to be made. </p>              <p>I UR=
GE three actions. First, drop the current race questions, which misleadingl=
y conflate race and nationality, and ask two new questions: one based on a =
streamlined version of today's ethnic and racial categories, and a separate=
, comprehensive nationality question. (The 2010 census asked Hispanics, Asi=
ans and Pacific Islanders to specify a national origin and allowed American=
 Indians and Alaska Natives to put down their tribe.) </p>              <p>=
These two questions would allow for much-needed flexibility. Broad racial g=
roupings are significant for protecting voting rights, but information on n=
ational origin is more useful for understanding health disparities in a met=
ropolis, or for diversifying a university's student body. Indeed, the failu=
re to appreciate rising inequality within the country's white majority and =
to distinguish, say, inner-city blacks from African asylum-seekers, or Sout=
heast Asian refugees from well-educated East Asians, have contributed to th=
e criticisms of affirmative action as too blunt a tool of social policy. </=
p>              <p>Second, add parental place of birth to the census. One-f=
ourth of Americans under the age of 18 are children of immigrants -- a prop=
ortion that will increase sharply over the next quarter-century. </p>      =
        <p>Third, slowly phase in the use of the data to make policy. There=
 is a precedent: in 2000, there was strong opposition to the new option of =
selecting more than one race. It was feared that this would reduce the size=
 of various racial minorities. The government responded by counting those w=
ho are white and of one minority race as minorities for the purposes of civ=
il-rights monitoring and enforcement. The new comprehensive statistics on n=
ational origin would be put to use judiciously. The five races would not di=
sappear from the statistical system, but neither would they be the only pol=
icy tool available.</p>              <p>Americans may hope for a colorblind=
 future, but we know that the legacy of discrimination continues to haunt u=
s; that some new immigrants are assimilated even as others are left behind;=
 that new versions of racism crop up, within as well as among the five &quo=
t;races.&quot; </p>              <p>Faced with these empirical realities, s=
tatistical ignorance is a moral failure. It is also a political failure to =
ignore the arrival of a hybrid America. Even the questions on race we use i=
n 2020 will be wrong for 2100. It will take decades of gradual re-engineeri=
ng to match census statistics to demographic realities. The Census Bureau i=
s prepared; what's missing is public awareness and political leadership. </=
